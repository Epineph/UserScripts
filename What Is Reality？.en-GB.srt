1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:07,720
﻿What happens if you just keep cutting in half?\h

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,880
Let’s start with an apple - and\h
a really really sharp knife.\h

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,440
You take the knife in your\h
hand and, with a flourish,\h\h

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,594
you slice the apple into two neat pieces.

5
00:00:18,594 --> 00:00:20,280
The apple halves become quarters,\h\h

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,080
then the quarters become eighths.\h

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,120
In front of you are smaller and\h
smaller pieces of pulpy white apple-\h

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,960
But by your fourteenth cut, a\h
regular rectangular pattern emerges,\h

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,560
And you realise the smooth apple flesh\h
is built out of an array of plant cells.\h

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,600
You keep on cutting, chopping the\h
cells into smaller and smaller pieces.\h

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,000
Another eight cuts reduces the cells into\h
complex molecules of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen,\h

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,187
And with a few more cuts, what was the apple is\h
now ten to the twenty seven individual atoms.\h

13
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:56,160
And you stop.
Is this it? Can you cut no more?\h

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,960
But your knife is incredibly sharp,\h
and you begin to chop into the atom,\h

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,760
Peeling away the cloud of electrons, and\h
revealing the seeming nothingness within.\h

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,200
Almost nothingness, for at the\h
centre sits the tiny atomic nucleus,\h

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,080
A hundred trillion times smaller\h
than the apple you started with.\h

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:22,120
But again you are undaunted and continue chopping,\h
the nucleus splits into protons and neutrons,\h

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:27,240
Protons and neutrons into quarks and gluons,
and you find yourself in the ethereal world\h\h

20
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,800
of the subatomic, a world governed\h
by fuzzy probabilities, the apple\h\h

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:39,120
nothing but an ethereal wave upon a sea of fields.
It feels like you have finally reached the limit,\h\h

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:50,120
the fundamental pieces of the universe.
Though some think you can keep going.\h

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,320
After more than a hundred cuts, pointlike quarks\h
and electrons might be revealed to be waving\h

24
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,040
strings,
Barely a trillionth\h\h

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,440
of a trillionth of a trillionth of a metre\h
across, vibrating across extra dimensions.\h

26
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,680
Down here, maybe even space and time are\h
chunky, fundamental blocks that can be cut no\h

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,400
more,
Or maybe any\h\h

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:15,880
semblance of reality will melt away, as we find\h
that our universe is truly a simulated cosmos,\h\h

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,480
churning away on some super-dimensional computer.
Or that our three dimensional existence is\h\h

30
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,120
nothing but an illusion, and everything we\h
know and love is shown to be a hologram.\h

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:34,040
Or even more strangely, maybe it’s just\h
raw mathematics -all the way to the bottom.\h

32
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:44,760
But which is true? And how can we be sure?
To understand reality, the true nature of reality,\h\h

33
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,760
and how humanity over thousands of\h
years has struggled to unravel it,\h\h

34
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:56,486
we are going to have to dissect the cosmos\h
- and ask some very difficult questions.\h

35
00:02:56,486 --> 00:03:00,000
Is the apple…real?\h

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,760
You can hold it, smell it, taste it.
You can see the greenness of\h\h

37
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,080
its skin in the sunlight.
Surely the apple is real.\h

38
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:27,680
But what does it mean to be real?
Just what is reality?

39
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,280
Isaac Newton used to bookmark the pages in\h
his books in a very specific way - he would\h\h

40
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,040
turn the corner of the page down onto the\h
phrase or even word he wanted to remember.\h

41
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,400
Of course, it was easier for him to concentrate -\h
as he had no mobile phone determined to distract\h\h

42
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,760
him or suck him into endless doom-scrolling.
And so our sponsor today is the perfect\h\h

43
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,520
learning tool for our modern age..
If you care about building a life of learning,\h\h

44
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,440
imprint is the app for you. if you haven’t used it\h
before you probably haven’t seen anything like it\h

45
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,920
It provides bite-sized lessons that take only\h
a few minutes, and are beautifully illustrated\h\h

46
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,160
and animated creating a highly visual,\h
effective, and interactive learning experience.\h

47
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,240
Their library includes courses, book summaries,\h
and quick-read articles on topics like psychology,\h\h

48
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,440
philosophy, physics, productivity,\h
science, history, and many more.\h

49
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,040
I personally have been enjoying Carlo Rovelli´s\h
dive into the mindbending physics of time. Another\h\h

50
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,760
exciting option i've been looking through is\h
thinking fast and slow by Daniel Khaneman, which\h\h

51
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:30,840
helped me understand my own cognitive biases.
So now is a great time to try everything Imprint\h\h

55
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,120
To our truly ancient ancestors,\h
reality must have been obvious.\h

56
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,000
From the planes of Africa to those wandering\h
the snowy wastes of Northern Europe,\h

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,680
Reality was what you sensed with\h
your eyes and ears, touch and tongue.\h

58
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,400
Reality was simply out there.
The snap of a twig in a forest\h\h

59
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,120
might tell them that their next meal is at hand,
Or warn them that they might be on the menu for\h\h

60
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:23,840
a beast with bigger teeth and sharper claws.
Sensing reality was a matter of life or death.

61
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,800
Perhaps, in their day-to-day struggles, these\h
truly distant ancestors had little time to wonder.\h

62
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,720
Little time to think deeply about\h
the world that surrounded them.\h

63
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,240
But as the human mind developed\h
and thoughts expanded,\h

64
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,560
The nature of reality surely changed too.

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,400
We know humans began to bury their dead\h
almost one hundred thousand years ago.\h

66
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,840
Quite what they were thinking as they\h
farewelled their loved ones we will never know.\h

67
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,320
But perhaps they were thinking of a\h
world beyond our reality, an afterlife.

68
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,320
These ceremonies provide\h
insight into human thought,\h

69
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,280
And that there was more to reality\h
than meets the eye, or ear or nose.\h

70
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,840
Ideas around spirits and gods and invisible,\h
yet powerful, influences began to emerge,\h

71
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,740
Along with questions of meaning and purpose.

72
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,240
The gods also gave us the apple,\h
providing delicious fruit for us to eat.\h

73
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,840
There was no need to question the\h
reality of the apple beyond this,\h

74
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:32,600
The answer was beyond the ponderings of the human\h
mind - only found in the thoughts of the gods.

75
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,280
Plato was one of the greatest\h
philosophers of the ancient world.

76
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,120
Living in Athens in the fourth century B.C,\h
his real name was Aristocles, with Plato being\h\h

77
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,440
just a nickname - a nickname that meant broad\h
and apparently referred to his stocky build.

78
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:59,640
The material world bothered Plato.
Where do objects get their material properties?\h

79
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,360
Be it the greenness of the apple skin,
Or the fact that dogs have four legs.

80
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,400
Our world, Plato contended,\h
was not the real world.\h

81
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,643
And to understand this, we will have to\h
explore his famous allegory of the cave.

82
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:19,800
Plato asked us to think about a deep cave.\h

83
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,600
In this cave, a group of prisoners\h
are kept chained, staring at a wall.\h

84
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,920
The prisoners have always been\h
there, chained in the cave,\h

85
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,640
And have never been outside\h
and experienced the real world.

86
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,760
All the prisoners can see is the\h
wall in the cave, in front of them.\h

87
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,360
And on the wall, they see shadows.
These are formed by sunlight\h\h

88
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,480
streaming into the cave entrance,
With the shadows formed as people\h\h

89
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,854
go about their daily business\h
at the mouth of the cave.

90
00:07:45,956 --> 00:07:47,880
images of experiences they could never have.
What are they to make of this external\h\h

91
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:55,240
reality, one that they can barely see?
How are they to understand the real world?

92
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,840
But we can go further.
What if they are not\h\h

93
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,680
really seeing shadows of reality\h
from beyond the mouth of the cave?\h

94
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,360
What if, instead, some mischievous people\h
have blocked off the cave entrance,\h

95
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,760
And are illuminating the\h
prisoner’s wall with a bright fire?

96
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,760
With this light, these people can now\h
play mind games with the prisoners,\h

97
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,360
Using shadow puppets to play\h
out stories on the wall.\h

98
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,840
No longer are the prisoners simply seeing\h
people wander by the cave entrance,\h

99
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,120
Now they can see stories of monsters\h
and battles, castles and kings.

100
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,960
What are the prisoners to make of this new\h
reality? Is it any less real than before?\h

101
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,440
To them, this image on the wall is\h
their reality, there is nothing else,\h

102
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,360
And so, these exciting new tales are as real\h
as the previous shadow people milling about.\h

103
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,640
To them, the monsters and battles are truly real.

104
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,280
Plato then asks us to consider\h
that we are like the prisoners.\h

105
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,640
And the reality we experience every\h
moment of the day is a projection,\h

106
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,840
A projection of a place\h
where true reality plays out,\h

107
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,640
With our imperfect world being a\h
shimmering image of perfection.

108
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,320
To Plato, our experiences are\h
just shadows of a true reality.

109
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,200
Considering what we know now,\h
this was oddly prescient.

110
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,040
But for the story of reality,\h
this was just the beginning.\h

111
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,280
To reveal to the secrets of the universe,\h\h

112
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,920
to unveil the ultimate truth\h
of the nature of the cosmos,\h

113
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,480
The answers did not lie in the hands\h
of the gods or ancient philosophy.\h

114
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,360
Instead, we would have to delve deep into the\h
fundamental makeup of matter, time, and space.\h

115
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,880
We would have to turn to the insights into\h
reality provided by scientific exploration.\h

116
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:51,640
And when we did,
Things quickly got very strange indeed.

117
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:57,880
“…Philosophy will clip an Angel’s wings,
Conquer all mysteries by rule and line,\h

118
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,320
…Unweave a rainbow…”

119
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,440
In the first few months of 1821,\h
the poet John Keats died in Rome.\h

120
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,200
He was young, only twenty-five, but his body\h
was wracked by the scourge of tuberculosis.\h

121
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,080
In his short time, he was prodigious, writing\h
on the natural beauty of the world around us.\h

122
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,480
And like many before and after, he was\h
only truly recognised after his death.

123
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,920
Keats was born almost seventy years\h
after the death of Isaac Newton.\h

124
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,160
It was the time of the Industrial Revolution,\h\h

125
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,720
a revolution driven by Newton’s\h
insights into the natural world.\h

126
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,320
The scientific revolution of Newton and his\h
contemporaries had sought to peel back reality,\h

127
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,160
And reveal it as nothing more than a\h
manifestation of physical law in action.

128
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,720
And finally it was Newton who had\h
realised that the white light of\h\h

129
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,000
the Sun contained all the colours of the rainbow,\h

130
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,800
And that water droplets in the sky spread sunlight\h
into a glorious display from red to violet.\h

131
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,160
The seemingly mystical appearance of one of\h
nature’s true wonders had, Keats complained,\h

132
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,760
Been destroyed by Newton reducing\h
it to little more than a prism.

133
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:16,560
In Keats words, Newton had\h
tried to unweave the rainbow.

134
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,160
Newton’s triumph might have been Keat’s lament,
But as Newton began to unweave the\h\h

135
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,600
nature of light,
He kickstarted a\h\h

136
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:32,000
long tradition of science peeling away the\h
very nature of reality to expose its bones.

137
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,120
Let’s think again about our apple,
Of course, one of the defining characteristics\h\h

138
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,840
of a ripe apple is its colorful skin.
But just where does this colour reside?

139
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,430
Apples are made of a complex mix of water,\h
sugars, and more complex structures.\h

140
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,720
So why do we see the apple appear green?

141
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,240
To answer this question, we must delve\h
deeper into the meaning of colour.

142
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:03,360
And the story begins with the\h
last man who knew everything.

143
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,520
Thomas Young was born in the tiny\h
Somerset town of Milverton in 1773.\h

144
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Precocious from the very start,\h
he learnt French, Greek, Italian,\h\h

145
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,760
Latin, Aramaic, Persian and more,
And was instrumental in deciphering\h\h

146
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,280
Egyptian hieroglyphics soon after\h
the discovery of the Rosetta Stone.

147
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,200
For some of you, Young’s name\h
might already be familiar,\h

148
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,520
As it was Thomas Young who undertook the first of\h\h

149
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,263
what’s known as the double slit experiment.
This experiment sits at the heart of many\h\h

150
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,560
We will come back to Young’s double\h
slit experiment later in our story.

151
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,240
Artists knew that mixing coloured\h
paints produces new colours,\h

152
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,920
And three colours – red, green, and blue\h
– seemed to be particularly important.\h

153
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,240
Young proposed that the eye contains three\h
kinds of fibres, fibres we now call cone cells,\h

154
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,800
One kind is sensitive to red,\h
another to green and another to blue.

155
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,720
The amount that each kind of cell is stimulated is\h
passed along the optic nerve and into the brain,\h

156
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,160
Where it is mixed like paint in the\h
mind to give us the sensation of colour.

157
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,000
Things, however, get weird when we\h
look at the eyes of other animals.\h

158
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,360
Our closest relatives - apes and monkeys\h
of the old world - are similar to us,\h\h

159
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,520
sensitive to three colour bands,\h

160
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,200
But most mammals only have two -\h
equivalent to our blue and green.\h

161
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,680
This must reduce their colour palette –\h
would they see a banana as being yellow?

162
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,720
Bees have three colour receptors, one\h
sensitive to blue, another to green,\h\h

163
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,840
and yet another to ultraviolet.\h

164
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Reptiles, fish, and birds can have\h
four or more colour receptors.\h

165
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:42,920
The small but violent mantis shrimp has a total\h
of twelve receptors spread across the rainbow.\h

166
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,600
These animals must see the world in an array\h
of colours that we can’t begin to imagine.

167
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:55,360
And so what are we to make from this\h
confusing array of animal visions?\h

168
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,680
For humans, the yellow of the rainbow matches\h
the stimulated signal from the skin of a banana,\h

169
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,280
But other creatures probably would not agree.\h

170
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,320
To them, maybe a strawberry or broccoli or\h
human skin is the same colour as a banana.

171
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,720
This tells us something deep\h
about the nature of reality.

172
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,000
Our sight is nothing but a\h
shadow of reality created\h\h

173
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,440
by our brains – it is subjective, not objective.
We live in a visual simulation of our own making,\h

174
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,120
Built from the stimulations\h
being fed into our brains.

175
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,080
Newton told us about raindrops and sunlight,
But the colours of the rainbow\h\h

176
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,720
exist only in our minds.
The sounds that we hear are similarly illusions,\h

177
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:46,373
An interpretation in our minds of vibrating\h
eardrums due to waves of pressure in the air.\h

178
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:54,560
Everything is subjective - we live in\h
a virtual reality of our own making!

179
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,040
So if what we perceive is not\h
truly reality, then what is?\h

180
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,593
How are we to build the nature of the universe\h
if we can’t trust information delivered\h\h

181
00:14:59,593 --> 00:15:02,351
by our senses?
Well, space and time can at least be trusted.\h

182
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:07,080
At least the apple is here and\h
now, that is one certainty.

183
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,800
Or is it?

184
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,880
For in the revolution that was\h
to follow Newton and Young,\h

185
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:21,800
No part of reality was safe.
________________\h

186
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,480
Time ticked by slower in the past than today.

187
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,000
And in twenty twenty-three,\h
astronomers measured by just how much.

188
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,400
Their focus was quasars from 12 billion\h
years ago, black holes weighing billions\h\h

189
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,600
of times the mass of the Sun.
Swirling in the intense gravity\h\h

190
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,680
of these black holes, matter orbits\h
at close to the speed of light,\h

191
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,760
This matter is heated to billions of degrees and\h
glows intensely, visible across the universe.

192
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:59,120
But in the turbulent maelstrom, before it\h
vanishes into the hole, matter crashes and grinds,\h

193
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,280
And the intense light brightens and\h
fades like a cosmic firework display.\h

194
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Hidden in this flickering, astronomers found\h
a subtle pattern, a special regularity,\h

195
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,960
and they realised they could use this quasar tick\h\h

196
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,640
to measure the passage of time\h
when the universe was young.

197
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,560
These astronomers compared the tick of a\h
clock today to the ticks of these quasars,\h

198
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,720
Finding that the farther away the quasar, the\h
slower and slower these quasar ticks became.\h

199
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,040
And when the universe was\h
one-tenth of its present age,\h

200
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,000
Relative to today, time was ticking\h
at one-fifth its current rate.

201
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,120
This result was spectacular\h
- but it was not unexpected.

202
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,720
For this cosmic dilation was written into the\h
mathematical laws that govern the universe,\h

203
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,320
In a theory developed more than\h
a century before - a theory that\h\h

204
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,840
forever changed the reality of space and time.

205
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,840
I think, therefore I am.
It was French philosopher,\h\h

206
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,160
Rene Descartes, who uttered these famous words.\h

207
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,400
And this deep musing on the reality of being\h
has reverberated through the centuries.\h

208
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,800
But Descartes stared into more\h
than the meaning of being.

209
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,800
One night in 1619, Descartes shut himself\h
away in a small room to avoid the cold.\h

210
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,800
As a mercenary fighting for\h
the Dutch Protestant State,\h\h

211
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,920
he had studied engineering and mathematics.
But this frigid night would be like no other.

212
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,640
The story goes that Descartes was confined to\h
his sick bed, staring aimlessly about the room,\h

213
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,360
He spied a fly walking across the ceiling,\h\h

214
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,600
before launching into flight, darting\h
about and settling on the wall.\h

215
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,640
As the fly buzzed about from\h
ceiling to wall and back again,\h\h

216
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:04,280
a thought wandered across Descartes’s mind.
How could he describe the journey of the fly?

217
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,840
He realised that he needed a reference\h
point to anchor the motion of the fly,\h

218
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,680
And while this point is arbitrary, he\h
must be consistent and not change it.\h

219
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,040
He also realised that talking about\h
the distance from this point to the\h\h

220
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,880
fly is simply not sufficient,
Because as well as the distance,\h\h

221
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,800
you need the direction of the\h
fly to fully describe its motion.

222
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,440
Then a startling thought came to\h
Descartes, a realisation that would\h\h

223
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,360
simplify the fly’s motion.
For his point of reference,\h\h

224
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,960
Descartes took the corner of the room,\h
where two walls meet the ceiling.\h

225
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,880
From this point, Descartes imagined\h
lines running along the joins,\h

226
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,680
Defining axes that meet at\h
the corner at right angles.

227
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,160
If you project the fly's\h
location onto each of these axes,\h\h

228
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,440
Descartes reasoned, then you get numbers,\h

229
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,280
And it is these three numbers that you need to\h
specify the location of the fly at any instant.\h

230
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,360
Three numbers to uniquely define a\h
location in three-dimensional space.\h

231
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:12,720
Three numbers that change continuously\h
with the ticking of the clock.

232
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,760
Descartes's coordinate\h\h

233
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,040
system seems obvious to us today, so normal.
Children are taught to use it when they encounter\h\h

234
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,960
location and motion in elementary science,
For professional scientists, laying down\h\h

235
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,120
a Cartesian coordinate system is\h
the start of finding solutions,\h

236
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,200
Descartes's name continues to\h
reverberate through the centuries.

237
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:38,120
Dying in sixteen fifty, Descartes was unaware of\h
a young boy growing up in the English countryside.\h

238
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,920
This boy, Isaac Newton, would grow to use these\h
notions of time and three-dimensional space,\h

239
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,680
Laying these down as the mathematical\h
stage on which all motion takes place.\h

240
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:54,720
It was Isaac Newton who laid out the rules\h
that we now call classical mechanics.

241
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,800
In Newton’s universe, time is a true absolute.\h

242
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,600
A single clock that ticks across the\h
universe, a tick that everyone agrees on.\h

243
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,960
Space was slightly more complicated, as\h
Descartes’s contemporary Galileo had discovered,\h

244
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:19,920
As each observer has the freedom to define\h
the origin of their own coordinate system.

245
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,000
Galileo thought more in terms of stories than\h
in the mathematics of Descartes or Newton,\h

246
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,560
And he laid out his notions on motions\h
in thinking about being onboard a ship.

247
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,680
He realised that if the ship was in a\h
harbour or sailing smoothly on a glassy sea,\h

248
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,560
Then the experience below deck would be identical.\h

249
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,840
However, if the wind picked up\h
and the ship began to speed up,\h

250
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,920
Or if it sailed into choppy waters\h
so the ship began to rock and roll,\h

251
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,720
Then those below deck would\h
feel this change in motion,\h

252
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,920
As plates and cutlery slide off tables,\h
and people become unsteady on their feet.

253
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,440
From this, Galileo declared that there\h
must be no absolute rest in the universe,\h

254
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,320
All motion, he said, must be relative,\h

255
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,920
And the laws of motion must be the same for\h
observers in a state of unaccelerated motion.

256
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:18,200
The first theory of relativity had arrived.

257
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,920
These ideas are reflected in Newton’s\h
equations of classical mechanics.\h

258
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Every observer in uniform motion can use Newton’s\h\h

259
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,800
three laws to calculate the\h
outcomes of experiments.\h

260
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,200
It’s easy to test this yourself by\h
dropping a ball on a train station\h\h

261
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,280
platform and seeing it fall to the floor.
Repeat the experiment on a train travelling\h\h

262
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,400
at a uniform constant speed and\h
again the ball will simply fall.

263
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,440
If, however, you drop the ball at the\h
start or end of the train journey,\h

264
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,440
The train will be accelerating up to speed, or\h
slowing down as it approaches its destination,\h

265
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,720
And dropping the ball at these times will see the\h
ball veer towards the back or front of the train,\h

266
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,040
Seemingly defying Newton’s laws as no\h
forces are pushing in these directions.\h

267
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:08,440
These fictitious forces only appear as\h
your coordinate system is accelerating,\h

268
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,920
And they vanish as soon as\h
you achieve uniform motion.

269
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,360
This picture of the background of\h
reality existed for several centuries,\h

270
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,960
Until a Scottish physicist, James Clerk Maxwell,\h\h

271
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:28,520
finally unravelled the mystery of light, and\h
with it, the bizarre reality of our universe.

272
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,000
Maxwell’s impact on science was enormous.
By the mid eighteen hundreds, Maxwell had\h\h

273
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,840
mathematically united electricity and magnetism.\h

274
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,480
There were experimental clues that\h
these strange phenomena were related,\h

275
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:51,040
But in a handful of equations, Maxwell showed\h
these two things were one and the same.

276
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,200
This was already an immense achievement, one for\h
which Maxwell would become scientifically famous,\h

277
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,760
But he looked deeper into his equations and\h
realised that they implied something profound.\h

278
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,240
He realised that light itself must\h
be an electromagnetic phenomenon,\h

279
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,200
Oscillating and intertwined fields\h
of electricity and magnetism.

280
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,800
His equations also revealed the\h
speed of light, a blistering\h\h

281
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:22,160
three hundred thousand kilometres per second,
But curiously, not what this speed is relative\h\h

282
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:28,440
to – by just whose coordinates\h
is this speed determined?

283
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,800
It seemed that a notion of absolute\h
rest would be needed to save physics.\h

284
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,880
Some had proposed that there was an absolute\h
background, an aether in which light propagated\h\h

285
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,560
throughout the universe, and had been\h
creating experiments to test the idea.

286
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,680
This included experiments\h
bouncing light rays off mirrors,\h

287
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,920
Or sending a current through an\h
electrical circuit and lighting a bulb.\h

288
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,080
The outcomes of these experiments would\h
depend on the motion relative to the aether,\h

289
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,760
And were built to demonstrate that the universe\h
must possess an absolute state of rest.

290
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,200
However, this would be a serious headache\h
for Galileo’s idea of relative motion.

291
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,600
Why would electromagnetism know about this state\h\h

292
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,400
of rest whilst the rest of\h
physics didn’t seem to care?\h

293
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,640
Why would Galileo’s relativity hold\h
for everything except electromagnetism?\h

294
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:27,000
Why would the physics of reality\h
have to be so complicated?

295
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,520
In nineteen o’five, one physicist stated\h
that it didn’t have to be so messy.\h

296
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:38,720
That the universe was not split into some physics\h
that obeyed Galileo and some physics that didn’t.\h

297
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,520
No - electromagnetism had to\h
respect relative motion also,\h

298
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,920
And so, at the start of the twentieth century,\h\h

299
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:56,960
Albert Einstein’s special\h
theory of relativity was born.

300
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,360
At its core, the special theory of relativity\h
reflects the dream of the lazy physicist,\h

301
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,840
The dream of explaining as much as\h
possible with as little as possible,\h

302
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,560
Einstein demanded that all observers,\h
irrespective of the relative motion,\h

303
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:18,120
Can use Maxwell’s equations to calculate\h
the outcome of electromagnetic experiments.

304
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,520
But this comes with an uncomfortable consequence,\h

305
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,960
As all observers must measure an\h
identical value for the speed of light.\h

306
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,560
And this was simply not possible with\h
Newton’s notion of space and time.

307
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:39,080
And so space and time, Einstein\h
claimed, are not rigid or absolute,\h

308
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:45,200
Instead, they must be flexible such that times\h
and distances depend on who is observing them.\h

309
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,920
This sounds like lunacy - indeed this is\h
not the experience of our everyday lives,\h

310
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:58,320
But experiments close to the speed of light\h
reveal this distortion of space and time.

311
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,400
And it was in the nineteen\h
sixties that irrefutable evidence\h\h

312
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,680
for the twisting of time was found,
The focus was on a subatomic particle,\h\h

313
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,960
known as a muon, effectively a\h
heavier version of the electron.\h

314
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,720
But, unlike the electron which lives forever,\h
muons only last for two-millionths of a second,\h

315
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,240
After this, the muon disintegrates\h
into electrons and neutrinos.

316
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,880
Physicists knew that high-energy muons\h
were made in the upper atmosphere,\h

317
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,640
Created when particles from deep\h
space smash into the gas molecules.\h

318
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,600
Travelling close to the speed of light, the muons\h
should travel half a kilometre before decaying,\h

319
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,880
But physicists detected muons arriving at the\h
ground, after travelling many tens of kilometres.

320
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,840
Why were these muons lasting so much longer\h
than their lifetime said they should?\h

321
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:52,440
The answer, physicists realised, lay in\h
Einstein’s special theory of relativity,\h

322
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,520
And, in particular, a quantity\h
known as the Lorentz factor,\h

323
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,400
A factor that dictates the dilation of time.

324
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,120
To explore this, we must understand the immediate\h\h

325
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,880
consequence that sprang from the\h
special theory of relativity.

326
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,960
The speed of light is an absolute\h
speed limit to the universe,\h

327
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,440
No matter how hard we try, or how\h
much energy we have available,\h

328
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,680
No object with mass could ever\h
get up to the speed of light.

329
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,600
The Lorentz factor depends\h
on the relative velocity,\h

330
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,760
But as speeds get closer to that of\h
light, the Lorentz grows unbounded,\h

331
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,840
And so, for the muon, its life is over\h
in just two-millionths of a second,\h

332
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,440
For the physicists here on Earth,\h
the muon’s life appears much longer,\h\h

333
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,240
and it makes it to the ground.

334
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:45,520
There is a flip side to this story, the other\h
side of Einstein’s strange relativistic coin.\h

335
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,480
The physicists see the long-lived muon\h
travelling tens of kilometres before decaying,\h

336
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,440
But if you could ask the muon, it would\h
say it had only covered a few hundred\h\h

337
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,440
metres in its short life,
Space, as well as time,\h\h

338
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,680
can be distorted and dilated when\h
speeds get close to that of light.

339
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:09,400
And Einstein also realised that this speed\h
limit had profound implications for information,\h

340
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,800
As this could also not be\h
transmitted faster than light.

341
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:18,800
A classic example is that we don’t see the Sun\h
as it is now, but as it was eight minutes ago,\h

342
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:24,680
And the light we see from the Andromeda\h
Galaxy set off before humans walked the Earth.

343
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:30,240
Through their telescopes, astronomers see galaxies\h
as they were billions of years ago in the past,\h

344
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,800
The universe as it is now is completely hidden\h
from us, we only spy as it was in the past,\h

345
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:47,280
Along what is known as our past light cone, and\h
the further they are, the younger they appear.

346
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,400
Other consequences from\h
Einstein’s view began to flow,\h

347
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,000
Where time and space mean different\h
things to different observers.\h

348
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,240
Without the absoluteness of Newton’s\h
time, there is no universally agreed now,\h

349
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:09,360
And the relative nature of time means that\h
observers disagree on how much time has passed.

350
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:16,360
Einstein immediately realised that this doomed\h
a cherished idea, the idea of synchronicity.\h

351
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,040
This is the notion that two\h
events, at two different locations,\h\h

352
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:24,640
happen at exactly the same time.
We experience this every day;\h\h

353
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,040
it is part of the rhythm of life\h
where things happen at certain times.

354
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,840
But this is all an illusion\h
- and to understand this,\h\h

355
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:39,000
let’s take a look at one of\h
Einstein’s thought experiments.

356
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,800
Consider three people riding\h
in a speeding train carriage.\h

357
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:48,080
One person stands at the back of the carriage,\h
one at the front and one is in the middle.\h

358
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:54,080
As the train trundles along at uniform speed,\h
these three people decide to do an experiment.\h

359
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,960
The person in the middle of the carriage has\h
equipment that will release a pulse of light.\h

360
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,440
That pulse of light will travel to the\h
back and the front of the carriage,\h

361
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,480
At either end of the carriage,\h
each person has a mirror that\h\h

362
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,760
reflects the pulse back towards the middle,
And at the instant the light is reflected,\h\h

363
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,400
the person at either end\h
raises their hands in the air.

364
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,640
Of course, in any practical train carriage,\h
this experiment would be over in a moment,\h

365
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,520
And the sluggish reaction time of the\h
people would be the limiting factor,\h

366
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,760
But this is the beauty of thought experiments,\h

367
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:31,120
We can ignore all those day-to-day limitations\h
and just concentrate on the physics.

368
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,400
Let’s think about the situation on the train.
Everything seems symmetrical, from the\h\h

369
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,600
light pulse heading out and its reflection,
To the pulse being received back in the middle of\h\h

370
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,160
the carriage and the experiment coming to an end.
And it seems reasonable to say that both hands\h\h

371
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:50,560
were raised at the same time – it was synchronous!

372
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,920
Let’s now think of the view of an\h
outside observer, not riding the train\h\h

373
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,440
but just standing on the platform.
And for fun, let’s make the train\h\h

374
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:05,720
move very fast, close to the speed of light.
Just what does this outside observer see as the\h\h

375
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:17,440
train roars by and the experimenters experiment?
Well, this is where it gets a little odd.

376
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,960
Our outside observer sees the experiment begin and\h
the pulses of light heading along the carriage.\h

377
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,200
But remember what Einstein’s\h
special relativity demands,\h

378
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,600
That all observers see light travel at\h
exactly the same speed – the speed of light.\h

379
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,120
What influence does this have\h
on what our observer sees?

380
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,440
As the train is moving,\h\h

381
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,640
the back of the carriage is reducing the\h
distance that the light has to travel,\h

382
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,960
While the front of the carriage is moving away,\h
increasing the distance to the reflecting mirror.\h

383
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,640
The light eventually bounces off each\h
of the mirrors and makes its way back\h\h

384
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,680
to the middle of the carriage.
With the distances changing again,\h\h

385
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,040
eventually, both pulses make it back\h
to the middle at the same instant.

386
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:04,040
When the outside observer is interrogated on what\h
they saw, how will they describe the experiment?\h

387
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,640
They will say that they saw the\h
pulses emitted at the same time,\h

388
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,240
And that they saw the pulses arrive\h
back in the middle at the same time,\h

389
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,240
But they saw the reflections and\h
hands being raised at different times!

390
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:23,200
Synchronicity depends on\h
who is doing the observing!

391
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,840
Whilst Einstein was pleased with his theory of\h
relativity, he immediately spotted a problem.\h

392
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,640
And that problem was gravity.
Isaac Newton had given us his equations to\h\h

393
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,400
describe gravity back in the seventeenth century,
And these worked well in explaining the rate at\h\h

394
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,560
which an apple falls from the\h
tree or the orbit of the moon.

395
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,640
Newton’s equations, however, depended\h
on the distance between masses.\h

396
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:54,120
In Newton’s universe, where time is absolute, we\h
can talk about the separation at a precise now,\h

397
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,720
But in Einstein’s universe, where\h
now is not universally defined,\h

398
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,640
Just which separation of the\h
masses should we consider?

399
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,600
Which now is now?

400
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,080
The lack of synchronicity threw out\h
the notion of a unique separation,\h

401
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,520
And Einstein could find no way to shoehorn\h
Newton’s gravity into his relativity.\h

402
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,960
And so eventually, he had no choice but to\h
reject Newton’s gravity in its entirety,\h

403
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,880
He had to go back to the drawing board\h
and redefine gravity from the ground up.

404
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,120
But where in his equations\h
could gravity be included?\h

405
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,640
The answer was even more bizarre\h
than what had come before.

406
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:43,320
Both time and space were malleable.

407
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:49,000
Gravity could be encoded in the bending\h
and stretching of the fabric of the cosmos.\h

408
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,440
It took a decade of effort, but in nineteen\h
fifteen, Einstein had cracked the mathematics.

409
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:00,800
It is this general theory of relativity that\h
we describe the action of gravity today.\h

410
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:07,040
No longer is gravity a force between two\h
masses, now it is the curvature of spacetime.\h

411
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,440
It is this mathematics that we use\h
to describe the expanding universe,\h

412
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,160
And even use in our daily lives to help run GPS.

413
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:21,760
The conclusions of Einstein’s\h
relativity still hold across the cosmos.\h

414
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,000
There is no synchronicity,\h
no universally agreed now.\h

415
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,480
Time and space can be\h
immensely warped and distorted,\h

416
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:38,480
And whether things exist at the same time\h
is simply in the eye of the observer.

417
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,080
And so now we can return to the\h
remarkable quasar study from 2023.\h

418
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,640
Did time really run slower\h
when the universe was young?\h

419
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:55,800
Well, if you were there, back in the infant\h
cosmos, one second would feel like one second,\h

420
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,200
But as the universe expands, the light\h
that travels through it is stretched.\h

421
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,080
This malleable, stretchy nature\h
of spacetime leads to what we\h\h

422
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,880
observe in the distant cosmos\h
being pulled thin across time.\h

423
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,880
And so it seems to us that the distant\h
past ticked by at a slower pace.

424
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,240
And an even more extreme version of this concept\h\h

425
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,760
is shown in the time dilation\h
experienced around black holes.\h

426
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,240
Spacetime is warped to impossible\h
extremes in the centre of a black hole,\h

427
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,920
But it is also warped and stretched\h
as you get closer to the horizon.\h

428
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,720
And so your experience of time slows\h
down in comparison to distant observers.

429
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,200
And bizarrely, these two ideas,\h\h

430
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,600
time dilation around black holes and\h
time dilation in the distant past,\h\h

431
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:53,600
despite the vastly different contexts in which\h
they arise, are effectively the same thing. 
 \h

432
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:59,920
And so from the earliest decades of the twentieth\h
century, our vision of time was changed forever.\h

433
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,840
In Einstein’s revolutionary view of the universe,\h
the passage of time is utterly personal.\h

434
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:11,200
Your clock, be it mechanical like a watch\h
or biological like the beat of your heart,\h

435
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,320
Ticks and tocks at a regular\h
one second per second.

436
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,280
Other people’s clocks can tick\h
radically relative to yours,\h

437
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,040
If they are moving differently to you,\h

438
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,280
If they sit somewhere differently to\h
you, in a different gravitational field,\h

439
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,520
Or, as we saw at the start, they are located in\h
a different epoch of the life of the universe.

440
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,680
This bending of time is truly part of the cosmos,\h

441
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,080
The long-lived muons smashing into the\h
surface of the Earth are a testament to this,\h

442
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,240
As are experiments where atomic clocks\h
are taken for journeys around the Earth,\h

443
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:48,600
Ticking their own ticks so they are\h
desynchronised when they are reunited.

444
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:54,360
And we might be able to use this relative\h
nature of time to travel into the future.\h

445
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,440
All we need to is hang out in the intense\h
gravitational field of a black hole,\h

446
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,480
A place where time, relative to the rest of\h
the universe, effectively grinds to a halt,\h

447
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:16,160
So, whilst minutes or hours pass for you, when you\h
emerge years and decades will have passed outside.

448
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Pulling yourself away from the distant universe,\h
you drag your attention back to the apple.\h

449
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,600
You are sure that the apple is here right\h
now, no more than a couple of metres away.\h

450
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:36,640
But you now have to accept that your now is\h
precisely that, the now that belongs to you.\h

451
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,443
Another way that your reality\h
is yours and yours alone.

452
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,040
This thought makes you furrow your\h
brow as the idea swirls in your mind.

453
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,640
When and where reality is seems\h
to be a slippery question - but\h\h

454
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:59,680
what it is could perhaps be simpler?
What is the world around you…made of?

455
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:12,000
How would you dismantle the universe?

456
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,240
THE ATOM SPLIT. HUGE FORCE RELEASED.

457
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,800
So screamed the headlines of\h
the Melbourne Argus in May 1932.

458
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,520
Cambridge Achievement.\h
Success of British Scientists.

459
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,000
The nature of reality had\h
been smashed into pieces.

460
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,880
This headline was carried in a newspaper\h\h

461
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,000
twenty thousand kilometres from\h
the laboratory in Cambridge,\h

462
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,320
A testament to the earth-shattering\h
nature of the discovery.\h

463
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,120
A goal of ancient philosophers and\h
seers had finally been achieved,\h

464
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:48,760
For the British scientists, Ernest Walton and\h
John Cockcroft, were modern-day alchemists.

465
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:54,400
But instead of fire and brimstone, their\h
laboratory gleamed with metal and wires.\h

466
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,360
With electricity, magnetism, and a beam of\h
particles, they were able to transmute elements,\h

467
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,280
Lithium was spliced into two\h
new atoms, atoms of helium.\h

468
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:13,760
Their discovery showed that the world of the\h
subatomic was now in the physicists’ grasp.

469
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,000
The question of just what matter is had been\h
on the minds of philosophers for a long time.\h

470
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,480
Some objects were clearly similar; stones\h
of various shapes and sizes were hard,\h

471
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,360
while the solidness of stones contrasted\h
with the squishiness of human flesh.\h

472
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:33,560
They seem quite different, even\h
fundamentally different, at their core.

473
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,560
Philosophers had wondered if the stuff\h
of nature was infinitely divisible,\h

474
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:43,080
Whether you could continue to slice it and\h
dice it into smaller and smaller pieces.\h

475
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,400
But ancient Greek and Indian\h
thinkers had a new thought,\h\h

476
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,400
that things are composed of ultimate pieces.\h

477
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,320
Tiny pieces we now know as atoms\h
from the Greek for uncuttable.

478
00:39:53,320 --> 00:40:00,680
To the ancient philosophers, these atoms\h
were the fundamental pieces of reality.

479
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,040
The notion that all things\h
are made of atoms remained\h\h

480
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,120
a philosophical musing for a few thousand years,\h

481
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:12,240
But by the eighteenth century, scientific evidence\h
for the physical existence of atoms was emerging.\h

482
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:23,800
And not from the experimental laboratories\h
of physicists, but from that of a botanist.

483
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,280
The botanist in question was Robert\h
Brown, born in Scotland in 1773.\h

484
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,160
He had a distinguished career,\h
travelling the world in the ship,\h\h

485
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,720
The Investigator, to chart plant life.

486
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,600
Many years later, in 1827, he was\h
still studying the world of planets,\h\h

487
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:44,640
but his focus was tiny grains of pollen.
This pollen was floating on the surface of water,\h\h

488
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,640
and Brown examined it under a microscope.
But what Brown saw mystified him.

489
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:56,160
Instead of sitting restfully in the water,
He saw them dance and jiggle.

490
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,200
Brown knew that pollen came from plants, so\h
perhaps the jiggling was due to life in action.\h

491
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,760
That the pollen grains were able to\h
propel themselves through the liquid.\h

492
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:11,000
But other materials, clearly dead material\h
like chalk dust, showed the same kind of dance.\h

493
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,600
This Brownian motion had nothing to do with life.

494
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,560
Many people pondered the question of\h
the jiggling pollen as seen by Brown,\h

495
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,760
But the answer would not be found for\h
another seven decades - until 1905,\h

496
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,000
arguably the most famous year in all of science,

497
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,120
Albert Einstein´s annus mirabilis.

498
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:38,040
In this year of miracles, Einstein is generally\h
remembered for one particular discovery,\h

499
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:43,560
His special theory of relativity and all the\h
weirdness of space and time that conveys.\h

500
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,440
But it is also the year he revolutionized\h
quantum physics through the photoelectric effect,\h

501
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:57,240
And he finally explained the weird\h
motion found by Robert Brown.

502
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,800
Einstein’s insight is as\h
simple as it is brilliant.\h

503
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,160
He realised that the jiggling of the pollen\h
was not the pollen propelling itself,\h

504
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,280
But being propelled by external forces,\h

505
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,120
Forces delivered by the collision\h
of individual water molecules.

506
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,800
But how can this possibly be?
A pollen grain, whilst tiny,\h\h

507
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,360
is a billion billion billion times\h
heavier than a water molecule.\h

508
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:27,120
How can the crash of a water molecule\h
into pollen have any influence at all?

509
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,800
Imagine you are at a truly massive rock\h
concert with music blasting from the stage.\h

510
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,920
You are deep in the crowd, a crowd\h
of tens of thousands of people.\h

511
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,080
Now and again, the crowd surges to\h
the left or right, front or back,\h

512
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,320
And in these surges, all you\h
can do is go with the crowd.

513
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,520
Intermittently, the surges die away, as you stand\h
shoulder to shoulder with your fellow revellers.\h

514
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,360
The crowd is restless, and you are jostled from\h
all sides, a push from here and a push from there.\h

515
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,040
Your body moves with the pushes\h
as you try and hold your space,\h

516
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,320
But you slowly start to jiggle\h
about due to the relentless pushes.

517
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,640
The pushes are not even, sometimes more\h
from the right, sometimes the left,\h\h

518
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,400
sometimes front or back, with you unable\h
to predict when the next push will come.\h

519
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:21,400
No matter what you do, your entire body moves\h
a little this way, and a little that way.

520
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,600
Einstein realised that Brownian motion was\h
precisely this kind of drunkard’s walk.\h

521
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:31,400
Every second, he said, an uncountable number\h
of water molecules collide with a grain.\h

522
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,520
The net result is that these fluctuations\h\h

523
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,040
in collisions back and forth\h
lead to the random jiggling,\h

524
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,760
and the pollen grain dances\h
along to the molecular tune.

525
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,760
From his calculations, Einstein\h
was able to calculate the size\h\h

526
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,560
of the collisions and their fluctuations,
Confirming that water was comprised of an immense\h\h

527
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:57,360
number of absolutely microscopic molecules.
And so atomic hypothesis became atomic\h\h

528
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,000
reality, and atoms appeared to be\h
the building blocks of our world.

529
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,880
And yet just as their existence was proved,\h
these indivisible atoms began to divide.

530
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,280
It was in 1896, that Henri\h
Becquerel and Marie Curie\h\h

531
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,960
found that the world of the atom was unstable,
And that some elements could transmute into\h\h

532
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:24,320
others, spitting out other pieces as they did so -\h
and in 1897 J.J. Thomson discovered the electron.

533
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,520
Something was living inside\h
the atoms that made up reality,\h

534
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:33,440
And the race to split the atom,\h
and reveal its contents, was on.

535
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,520
For his discovery, Thomson was\h
awarded a Nobel Prize in 1906,\h

536
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,800
But it was his protégé that was to\h
truly reveal the structure of matter,\h

537
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:50,920
The father of nuclear physics, Ernest Rutherford.

538
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,360
In the first decade of the twentieth\h
century, Rutherford set two young\h\h

539
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,440
men to probe the structure of matter.
In a darkened room at the University of\h\h

540
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,840
Manchester, they peered into inky blackness.
They were looking for tiny flashes that\h\h

541
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,040
indicated a collision, as tiny\h
pieces hit a fluorescent screen.\h

542
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,520
And the results so far had\h
been as precisely expected.

543
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,640
The two men were Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden.
Geiger’s name would be immortalised in\h\h

544
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,360
the radiation detector named after him,
But that still lay several years into his future.\h

545
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:29,280
For now, he patiently stared into the darkness,\h
logging each of the tiny flashes that he spied.

546
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,680
The experiments continued, counting\h
flash after flash, until one day,\h\h

547
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,960
Rutherford suggested that they look for\h
flashes where none should be expected.\h

548
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:44,480
So, Geiger and Marsden dutifully modified their\h
experiment and again stared into the darkness,\h

549
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,960
And it was then they changed our\h
understanding of physical reality forever.

550
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,800
Rutherford, was stunned, saying it was\h
the most incredible event of his life.\h

551
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,760
At forty years old, he was still\h
quite young but had already been\h\h

552
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,000
awarded a Nobel Prize for his work.
But with this new experiment,\h\h

553
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,760
the atomic world would never be the same again.

554
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:13,760
But why? What had they seen\h
- and what had it meant?

555
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,080
Thomson’s discovery of the electron had\h
provided new clues to the structure of atoms.\h

556
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,600
The electron clearly carried\h
some negative electric charge,\h

557
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:29,080
So, inside the atom must be a mix of positive and\h
negative charges, as overall they are neutral.\h

558
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:33,640
The question was just how\h
this charge was distributed.

559
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,600
Thomson had proposed his model\h
for the nature of the atom,\h

560
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,560
Something we now know as the plum pudding model.\h

561
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,560
Confusingly, a plum pudding\h
doesn’t contain any plums,\h\h

562
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,960
but it is actually a fruit cake with raisins.
And the electrons, Thomson said, were just\h\h

563
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,760
like these raisins, suspended\h
in a positive mixture of cake.

564
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,520
It was precisely this model of the atom that\h
Rutherford was testing in his experiment.\h

565
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:02,520
He created a beam of alpha particles, charged\h
helium nuclei emitted from a radioactive source,\h

566
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:08,400
And directed them to crash into a foil of gold.
It was the recoil of these collisions that\h\h

567
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:16,720
Geiger and Marsden were looking for as\h
they peered for flashes in the dark.

568
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,440
As the alpha particles impacted the gold foil,\h\h

569
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,080
many of them sailed right through,\h
missing the gold atoms entirely.\h

570
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:29,800
However, now and again, an alpha particle would\h
crash directly into an individual gold atom.\h

571
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,400
Rutherford surmised that these should feel the\h
push and pull of the charges within the atom,\h

572
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,720
And their paths would be\h
deflected out of the beam.

573
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,120
If Thomson was correct, and the atom was a\h
general mix of positive and negative charge,\h

574
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,920
Then these deflections would be relatively\h
modest, flung only slightly from the beam.\h

575
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,200
And this is what Geiger and Marsden\h
had spied as they sat in the darkness\h\h

576
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,840
of their Manchester laboratory.
But following Rutherford’s suggestion,\h\h

577
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:59,760
they also found alpha particles\h
scattered far, far from the beam.

578
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,160
Rutherford was astonished.

579
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,800
For an alpha particle to be\h
so radically scattered was\h\h

580
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,040
simply impossible in Thomson’s vision of the atom.

581
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,680
Rutherford would go on to say:

582
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,800
“It was quite the most incredible event that has\h\h

583
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,760
ever happened to me in my life. It was\h
almost as incredible as if you fired\h\h

584
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,240
a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue\h
paper and it came back and hit you.”

585
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,160
But the question remained - if Thomson’s atom\h\h

586
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,160
could not explain the scattering\h
of alpha particles, what could?

587
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:33,240
Rutherford concluded that instead of\h
being spread out, the positive charge\h\h

588
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,480
must be tightly concentrated,
So that there is an immense\h\h

589
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,720
electromagnetic repulsion between the\h
atomic charge and the alpha particle.\h

590
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,640
So immense, in fact, that the alpha\h
particle can be flung in any direction.

591
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:56,840
This led to a rather confounding\h
picture of what just an atom is.

592
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,920
Rutherford knew that the electrons in\h
the atom carried a negative charge,\h

593
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,960
This charge must be broadly spread\h
over the volume of the atom,\h

594
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,920
Spread so thinly that they barely\h
influence the alpha particles.

595
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,920
The electrons, however, carried very little mass.

596
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,720
This meant the totality of the mass must sit in\h
the positive charge at the nucleus of the atom.\h

597
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:23,760
But whilst massive, this nucleus is very small,\h
tens of thousands of times smaller than the atom,\h

598
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:30,000
With this, the vast majority of the volume\h
of an atom became nothing but empty space.

599
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,520
With Rutherford’s insights, the startling\h
Pandora’s box of nuclear physics was open.

600
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,400
Rutherford’s atom fractures our view of reality,\h\h

601
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,400
of the apparently solid nature\h
of the world around you.\h

602
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,120
Every chair, every wall, every\h
tree, every apple is made of atoms,\h

603
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:52,240
Tied together into a myriad of molecules that\h
define structure, colour and everything else.\h

604
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,920
But it seems that this is\h
nothing more than an illusion.

605
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,480
apples are made of water, vitamins\h
and butyl and hexyl acetate,\h\h

606
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,920
the molecules responsible for its taste,\h

607
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:08,880
But each atom in each molecule is really a cloud\h
of electrons surrounding a miniscule nucleus.\h

608
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,760
And the vast majority of each\h
atom is nothing but empty space.\h

609
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:18,960
The apple is mostly empty space, and\h
its solid appearance is but an illusion.

610
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,360
Of course, it is not only the\h
apple, but everything that\h\h

611
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:26,640
has the illusion of being solid.
Everything, including yourself.

612
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,320
This is disconcerting, but maybe you can try\h\h

613
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,640
and comfort yourself with this\h
image of yourself and reality.\h

614
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,040
Maybe it's ok that atoms are\h
mostly nothing but empty space,\h

615
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,680
They are still made of something,\h
with a nucleus and orbiting electrons.\h

616
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:49,480
Surely those pieces are real. Surely\h
those pieces are really there.

617
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:53,880
But as they had with the molecule and\h
atom before it, physicists would quickly\h\h

618
00:50:53,880 --> 00:51:03,520
realise that the mysterious nucleus of\h
an atom was also far from fundamental.

619
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:09,000
On the tenth of August nineteen\h
fifteen, a sniper found his target.\h

620
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,600
His rifle trained on the enemy,
He steadied his breathing and began\h\h

621
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:19,400
to apply gentle pressure to the trigger.
Birds scattered as the shot rang out.

622
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,240
The sniper’s aim was true and\h
his enemy crumpled to the ground.\h

623
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,960
The sniper moved on – there\h
were plenty more to hunt.

624
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,600
Little did he know that his bullet had snuffed out\h\h

625
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:34,680
one of the greatest minds\h
of the twentieth century.

626
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:39,160
World War One cost twenty million\h
lives, both soldier and civilian,\h\h

627
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,560
with many more wounded and injured.
The failed Gallipoli Campaign, seeking to\h\h

628
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:49,800
weaken the Ottoman Empire cost a hundred thousand.
Every life lost is a tragedy, a missing loved\h\h

629
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,480
one whose potential goes unrealised.\h

630
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:57,440
But this is particularly\h
true of Henry G.J. Moseley.

631
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,880
For before he joined up to be a soldier,\h\h

632
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,560
something he did out of duty and\h
against the wishes of his family,\h

633
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:12,640
Moseley was a scientist who was unravelling\h
the inner workings of the atom's nucleus.

634
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,040
Born in 1887 in Dorset, England,\h
the son of an Oxford professor.\h

635
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:24,080
Moseley was a stellar student, studying at Oxford\h
before joining Rutherford in Manchester in 1910.\h

636
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,320
He had started to use X-rays\h
to bombard different elements,\h

637
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,120
With the hope of revealing\h
the secrets of their atoms.

638
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:36,480
As he did this, he had spied X-rays\h
being emitted at different energies,\h

639
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,240
and guessed something deep\h
with the atom was causing them.\h

640
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,640
There was also a pattern - in heavier elements,\h\h

641
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:47,240
thought to contain heavier atoms,\h
higher energy X-rays were emitted.

642
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:53,280
In Holland, the amateur physicist, Antonius\h
Johannes van den Broek, presented a bold idea.\h

643
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:59,400
He knew that electrons, carrying the negative\h
charge inside atoms, came in discrete chunks.\h

644
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,920
Each electron appeared to have\h
the same mass and the same charge.\h

645
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:13,200
What if the nucleus was the same,\h
built of separate but positive charges?

646
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,160
As atoms appear to be electrically neutral,\h

647
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,480
These positively charged chunks should exactly\h
balance the negatively charged electrons.\h

648
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:26,000
And the only difference between the elements would\h
be the number of positive charges in its nucleus,\h

649
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,880
As this would set the number of orbiting electrons\h
and dictate how the atom interacts with others.

650
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:37,160
The simplest element would have one of\h
these charges, the next two and so on.\h

651
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:43,920
Moseley realised that this was the pattern he was\h
seeing with his x rays, and with this one insight,\h

652
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,320
he rearranged the periodic table\h
based on what we now know as the\h\h

653
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:53,560
atomic number - still the form of\h
the periodic table that we use today.

654
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,600
Speaking in 1962, long after\h
Moseley’s untimely death,\h\h

655
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,880
the giant of quantum mechanics, Neils Bohr said\h

656
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,560
"You see actually the Rutherford\h
work was not taken seriously. There\h\h

657
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:10,000
was no mention of it in any place.
The great change came from Moseley."[

658
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,560
And who knows what else Moseley\h
would have contributed to science,\h

659
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:18,680
Had not been cut down by that\h
sniper’s bullet in nineteen fifteen.

660
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,960
Things moved quickly as the Great\h
War ground towards its eventual end.\h

661
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,680
It was again Rutherford, always at the\h
forefront who was deep in the discovery.\h

662
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:38,160
Through his investigations into radioactivity,\h
he finally uncovered the true nature of the atom.

663
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,000
Hydrogen was the simplest element,
Just one piece of positive charge\h\h

664
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,400
joined by one electron.
Whereas helium had two\h\h

665
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,400
positive charges and two electrons.
Then lithium with three of each,\h\h

666
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:55,000
beryllium with four, and so on and so on.
Like the electron, each of these positive\h\h

667
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,760
charges were identical,
Both in terms of the charge\h\h

668
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,520
they carried and the mass they were made of.
Rutherford named these positively charged,\h\h

669
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:07,400
massive particles, protons.
And eventually, in 1932 after\h\h

670
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:12,720
being theorised for years, the neutron was\h
also unambiguously identified in experiments.

671
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,160
The makeup of the atom was complete.

672
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,800
It had started off as a mess of complexity, of\h
different substances with different properties,\h

673
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,960
becoming simplified through the\h
realisation that the world is\h\h

674
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:27,040
built from ninety-two natural elements.
But with the discovery of the proton,\h\h

675
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:32,960
neutron and electron, things became simpler still,
With atoms of all the elements and their isotopes\h\h

676
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,880
built of nothing but these\h
three key pieces of reality.

677
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,960
In the outer reaches of the\h
atom roam the electrons,\h

678
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:47,160
Negatively charged tiny particles that\h
whizz around at close to the speed of light,\h

679
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,080
A million times smaller, at the very\h
heart of the atom, sits the nucleus,\h

680
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:56,600
Positively charged and comprised of protons and\h
neutrons, the nucleus is home to atomic mass.

681
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:01,600
But as Rutherford’s new view of atoms\h
took hold, others realised it spelt doom\h\h

682
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:08,240
for physics as they knew it.
It contained a fatal flaw:\h

683
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,560
There is, they said, no way an\h
electron can remain in its orbit,\h

684
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:20,520
Rutherford´s version of the atom\h
should not be able to exist at all!

685
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:25,320
The problem came from James Clerk\h
Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism,\h

686
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:31,720
These demanded that an accelerating charge must\h
radiate away its energy as electromagnetic waves.\h

687
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:38,640
And as an orbiting electron is in a constant state\h
of acceleration, it must constantly lose energy,

688
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:43,320
It should spiral into oblivion\h
in the nucleus of the atom.

689
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:48,080
There was nothing in the physical laws of\h
Newton or Maxwell that seemed to prevent this,\h

690
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,600
Nothing in the laws of reality as we understood\h\h

691
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:56,240
them could make matter stable.
So, physicists made a decision.

692
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:01,440
They decided to change the rules,
and in the process changed the nature\h\h

693
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:12,320
of reality forever
________________\h

694
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,400
In nineteen forty-three, the\h
father of quantum mechanics\h\h

695
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:20,960
Neils Bohr found himself in a predicament.
Germany had declared his family Jewish,\h\h

696
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,600
and his arrest was imminent,
So, with the help of the\h\h

697
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:30,720
Dutch resistance, he fled to neutral Sweden,
But his trials and tribulations were not over.

698
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,080
The British heard of his escape and\h
decided they needed this quantum legend.\h

699
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,320
The Second World War had been\h
raging for four long years,\h

700
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:42,200
And the Allies had decided that\h
a new weapon, an atomic weapon,\h\h

701
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:47,320
must be developed to end the carnage.
Bohr´s insights into the subatomic would\h\h

702
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,400
benefit them and stop the enemy\h
from following the same path.

703
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:56,680
Retrieved from Sweden and travelling in disguise\h
as James Baker, Bohr eventually made his way to\h\h

704
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:01,000
a secret town in New Mexico,
and there, at Los Alamos,\h\h

705
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,480
he contributed to the Manhattan Project\h
and the building of the atomic bomb.\h

706
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,800
Shyly, he always claimed that he wasn’t\h
really needed amongst the bright young minds,\h

707
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,880
But project director, Robert\h
Oppenheimer, disagreed:

708
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,200
“The early days of quantum mechanics were a\h
heroic time. It was not the doing of any one man;\h\h

709
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:24,440
it involved the collaboration of scores\h
of scientists from many different lands.\h\h

710
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:29,320
But from the first to last the deeply\h
creative, subtle and critical spirit of\h\h

711
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:36,360
Niels Bohr guided, restrained, deepened\h
and finally transmuted the enterprise.”

712
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,800
For three decades earlier, in\h
nineteen thirteen, as the world\h\h

713
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,440
had been on the precipice of another World War,\h

714
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:47,120
Bohr’s mind had been focused not on how\h
to unleash the power of the atom - but\h\h

715
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:52,760
the question of why atoms existed at all.
If Rutherford was right on the structure of\h\h

716
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,800
the atom, why didn’t the electron\h
simply spiral into the nucleus,\h

717
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:05,480
Just as the physical laws of\h
Newton and Maxwell demanded?

718
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,960
Revolution had been brewing for decades.

719
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,160
By the close of the nineteenth century,\h
physics had seemed pretty complete,\h\h

720
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:20,320
except for a few niggles - yet those niggles came\h
to dominate and rewrite physics as we know it.\h

721
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:26,040
And it all began with the\h
question of why hot objects glow.

722
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:30,400
Clearly, to make an object glow\h
you have to supply it with energy,\h

723
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,960
This energy makes atoms vibrate, vibrations\h
that generate light, the glow of a hot object.\h

724
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:40,360
We know that an iron poker in a fire\h
glows with a beautiful cherry red,\h

725
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:44,920
And as we make it hotter, this\h
red gives way to white and blue.

726
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,360
The question of why this particular choice of\h\h

727
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:51,280
colours became the focus of a\h
forty-two-year-old Max Planck,\h

728
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:56,040
Who combined the rules of established physics\h
to understand how matter and light interacted,\h

729
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:02,760
But his calculations failed time and time again\h
and as he reached a moment of absolute despair,\h

730
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:07,640
He decided to rewrite the physics rule\h
book - as many had done before him,\h\h

731
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:13,840
and would do after - but never again with\h
quite such far reaching ramifications.

732
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:18,520
Electromagnetic energy, he said,\h
came in distinct packets of light,\h

733
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:23,560
These discrete vibrations and\h
light packets being quantised.\h

734
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:33,000
And suddenly, Planck’s strange new\h
mathematics explained the glow of a hot poker.

735
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,480
Planck thought that all he had done was\h
perform a little mathematical wizardry,\h

736
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:42,920
But by nineteen o’five, Einstein also said that\h
light comes in discrete chunks, quanta of energy.\h

737
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:47,240
Explaining how electrons are ejected\h
from metal when under a light source.\h

738
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,800
Suddenly the quantized world\h
was popping up everywhere.

739
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:56,080
The quantum revolution was gathering pace\h
as the subatomic world was laid bare.\h

740
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:02,160
And it was Rutherford’s insights that showed\h
the atom itself would have to be quantized.\h

741
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,240
But just what rules governed\h
this quantized atom eluded him,\h

742
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:11,080
And these answers came from Bohr.

743
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:17,520
Electrons, said Bohr, were only allowed to\h
exist in distinct orbits about a nucleus.\h

744
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:23,080
These orbits are set by the momentum of the\h
electron, and so each orbit has a specific energy.\h

745
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:29,320
Electrons can move between orbits only if the\h
exact energy difference is absorbed or emitted,\h

746
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:34,800
And there would be the smallest orbit - that\h
brought the electron no closer to the nucleus.

747
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:39,480
In demanding electrons could only exist\h
in certain orbits with certain energies,\h

748
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:44,080
Bohr had quantized and saved the\h
atom from collapsing in on itself,\h\h

749
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:48,600
with only chunks of energy able\h
to change the atomic state.

750
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:52,320
This was a resounding success for\h
Bohr, securing him the Nobel Prize\h\h

751
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:56,200
in Physics in nineteen twenty-two.
But physicists still scratched\h\h

752
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:00,520
their heads as to why the atom was quantized.

753
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:05,680
This answer would come two years after Bohr\h
received his Prize in Sweden from a radical\h\h

754
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:11,280
proposition by a French aristocrat\h
and physicist, Louis de Broglie.

755
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,160
He had been watching the\h
quantum revolution unfold,\h

756
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:19,680
And was perplexed by the notion that light,\h
which was a wave in classical electromagnetism,\h

757
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:24,600
Sometimes behaved like a particle,\h
delivering its energy in a single punch.\h

758
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:30,640
In this quantum world, thought de Broglie, why\h
should matter not be subject to this duality?

759
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:35,240
So, he declared that an electron, which\h
had been thought of as a distinct particle,\h

760
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:39,200
Also possessed wave-like\h
properties in its existence.\h

761
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:44,200
Like light, de Broglie said, electrons\h
can be refracted and can interfere.

762
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:48,800
And it was Schrodinger who applied this to the\h
atom - asking us to think of the wave of the\h\h

763
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:54,320
electron as not at a precise point but spread\h
over the entirety of the orbit around the atom.

764
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:59,520
And so Bohr's quantized atom finally made\h
sense - the electrons were behaving as\h\h

765
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:05,840
waves - and could only have certain wavelengths.

766
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:11,160
Today, the notion that quantum objects can\h
be particles and waves is common knowledge,\h

767
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,600
But in its time, de Broglie’s ideas shook\h\h

768
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,233
the foundation of physics to its core.
Experiments soon followed to show that\h\h

769
01:03:16,233 --> 01:03:18,680
beams of electrons showed distinctly wave-like,
And in nineteen twenty-nine, de Broglie found\h\h

770
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:25,440
himself in Sweden receiving his own Nobel Prize.

771
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,720
By the nineteen-thirties, it seemed\h
that reality was all sewn up.\h

772
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:35,560
The periodic table was built of just three\h
particles, protons, neutrons and electrons,\h

773
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,800
Bound together in different\h
ways by the mathematical\h\h

774
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,240
rules of electromagnetism and quantum mechanics.

775
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:45,800
But even this neat picture\h
rapidly started to unravel.

776
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:51,520
In nineteen twenty-nine, Paul Dirac had been\h
focused on the equations of quantum mechanics,\h

777
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:57,000
His goal was to make quantum consistent with the\h
other great physics theory, Einstein’s relativity,\h

778
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,960
His new equations worked, but immediately\h
Dirac was puzzled by what they told him.\h

779
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:07,840
For as well as describing the behaviour of\h
electrons, something else was in the mathematics.

780
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:13,040
The equations also described a\h
positively charged electron, a positron,\h

781
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:17,200
A particle that seemed to have no\h
place in the orderly atomic world.\h

782
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,200
Perhaps, people thought,\h\h

783
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:22,240
it was nothing more than a mathematical\h
oddity that has no place in reality,\h

784
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:27,347
But by nineteen thirty-two, it was\h
unmistakably found in particle experiments.

785
01:04:27,347 --> 01:04:27,441
The positron was found in cosmic ray experiments,\h
high energy particles raining in from space.\h

786
01:04:27,441 --> 01:04:27,520
These smash into atoms inside the particle\h
detectors, generating new particles.\h

787
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:33,120
But soon after the discovery of the positron, a\h
much stranger particle appeared in the collisions,\h

788
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:37,652
One that had less of a place in\h
the atomic world than the positron.

789
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:43,600
It looked like an electron, with the same\h
electric charge, except for one key difference.\h

790
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:48,840
This new particle appeared to be two\h
hundred times as massive as the electron,\h

791
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:55,640
And unlike the electron, this new particle, the\h
muon, decayed in two-millionths of a second.

792
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:03,320
Why does the muon exist when it seems\h
that it’s not needed to build reality?\h

793
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,360
Indeed particle physicist Isodor Rabi quipped\h\h

794
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,640
“Who ordered that?” as the muon\h
made a mess of atomic neatness.

795
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,240
But the discovery of the muon\h
was the start of a cascade,\h

796
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:19,360
With many strange and differing\h
particles popping out of experiments.

797
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:23,440
Into the nineteen sixties, chaos\h
reigned in the world of the subatomic,\h

798
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:36,800
Until the next level of reality was laid bare\h
in what became known as the standard model.\h

799
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:42,480
It was realised that protons and neutrons, and\h
most other particles, are not truly fundamental,\h

800
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,440
But are made of smaller pieces known as quarks.

801
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,920
We now know there are six kinds of\h
quarks, grouped into three families.\h

802
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,520
The lowest mass quarks are known as\h
up and down, then charm and strange.\h

803
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,880
Most massive of all are top and bottom.\h

804
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:04,560
And the vast array of particles spat out in\h
experiments are combinations of these quarks.

805
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,360
Protons and neutrons are\h
built from up and down quarks,\h

806
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:11,360
Protons are two ups and a down while\h
neutrons are two downs and an up.\h

807
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,920
Three up quarks combine to form\h
a delta plus plus particle,\h

808
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:19,600
Whereas a D plus is a charm quark\h
combined with an anti-down quark.

809
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,440
As well as the quarks, there are also the leptons.\h

810
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,880
The electron and the muon and\h
the even more massive tauon.\h

811
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,960
Plus ghostly companions known as\h
neutrinos, one for each kind of electron.\h

812
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:39,320
So, the majority of reality we experience is a\h
combination of electrons and up and down quarks.

813
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:43,360
There are a few other pieces to the\h
standard model, and we will meet those soon,\h

814
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:49,760
But it is important to note that these\h
fundamental pieces appear to have no size at all.\h

815
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,480
These truly fundamental pieces\h
of reality are truly point-like,\h

816
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:59,600
So, each of your protons and\h
neutrons is effectively empty.

817
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:07,840
At the subatomic scale, your atoms are\h
even emptier than Rutherford found.

818
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:11,280
Your brow furrows as you\h
again think about the apple.\h

819
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,760
Knowing that it is mostly empty\h
space was disturbing enough,\h

820
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:19,760
But at least the electron and the\h
atomic nucleus seemed, well, solid.\h

821
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,840
In the quantum world, this is simply not the case.

822
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:29,600
Everything we thought was a particle is not.
Quantum matter shows wave-like properties,\h\h

823
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,200
spread out over space,
And not in any precise\h\h

824
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:36,120
location or with precise properties.
Your apple is nothing more than\h\h

825
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:42,800
a mix of these bizarre waves, all\h
combining to be the fruit you see.

826
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:47,720
You squint at the apple as the question\h
of quantum waves washes over your mind.\h

827
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:53,020
Just what are these waves?
And just what is doing the waving?\h

828
01:07:53,020 --> 01:08:03,840
And is this what reality is –\h
just a sea of subatomic waves?\h

829
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:11,200
________________
Imagine that you are in your kitchen,\h\h

830
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:16,000
mixing ingredients to bake a cake.
As you read through the recipe,\h\h

831
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,600
you see that you need a couple of\h
eggs, and so you head for the fridge.\h

832
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:25,040
In the fridge door, the eggs are neatly arranged\h
in lines, with some holes filled and some empty.\h

833
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:32,320
You close the door and get back to your\h
baking, thinking little of the remaining eggs.

834
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,920
In your mind, there are certainties.\h

835
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,800
When you open the fridge again,\h
the eggs will still be there,\h\h

836
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:42,560
occupying the same holes as before.
How could it be any other way?\h

837
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:49,160
But our modern understanding of reality suggests\h
that the universe is actually much stranger.

838
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:55,080
Instead of eggs, let’s think of a collection\h
of electrons similarly arranged in holes.\h

839
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:58,840
With the arrival of quantum mechanics\h
in the early twentieth century,\h

840
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:05,880
It was realised that electrons cannot be described\h
by the rigid rules of the physics of Newton,\h

841
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:12,920
Instead of exact positions and velocities,\h
electrons were described by probabilities.

842
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:16,480
We can only talk about the chance of\h
finding an electron here or there,\h

843
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:19,240
And if we observe an electron\h
in a particular hole, it will\h\h

844
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:22,200
have a probability of being in the other holes,\h

845
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:26,520
So next time you check on the electron,\h
it might have tunnelled into a new hole.\h

846
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:36,120
And all of the electrons might\h
have hopped between the holes.

847
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:41,120
And so why don’t the eggs in your fridge similarly\h
hop between the holes in your fridge door?\h

848
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:46,440
They too are governed by the rules of\h
quantum mechanics and so by probabilities.\h

849
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:51,760
Well, in a sense, they do.
For although the chance of an entire egg\h\h

850
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:57,440
quantumly jumping between holes is extremely tiny,
Whilst small, it is not zero!

851
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:04,280
Though very unlikely, within the laws of physics\h
everything is possible in the quantum world.

852
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:10,480
It is just a case of probability.

853
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:15,680
The quantum revolution dominated the\h
physics of the early twentieth century.\h

854
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:21,440
Great minds from the globe turned their\h
attention to the strange realm of the subatomic.\h

855
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,800
But not everyone was pleased with\h
what this revolution had to say,\h

856
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:30,040
Including perhaps the greatest\h
scientist of them all, Albert Einstein.

857
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:35,400
The problem started in nineteen twenty-six\h
in a paper by the physicist Max Born.\h

858
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,200
A year earlier, Erwin Schrodinger\h
published his eponymous equation,\h

859
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:44,200
This allowed physicists to calculate the\h
properties of de Broglie’s matter waves,\h

860
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:48,440
But Schrodinger didn’t know\h
just what these waves were.

861
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:55,240
Born, however, said that everything makes sense if\h
you interpret the waves as waves of probability.\h

862
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:01,440
The amplitude of this wave function tells you\h
the chances of an electron being here or there,\h

863
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:06,000
And as time ticks by, this\h
wavefunction can wash back and forth,\h

864
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:12,000
As the probabilities for an electron\h
being in a particular location change.

865
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,920
This answered one of the questions that had been\h
nagging physicists when considering quantum waves,\h

866
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:22,320
Because when they experimented on electrons,\h
they would see precise dings in their equipment,\h

867
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:27,600
They would detect individual\h
electrons as distinct particles.\h

868
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:32,080
So how could they exist also as quantum waves?

869
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:38,360
To Born, the particles like electrons behave like\h
waves as they travel from one place to another,\h

870
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:42,360
But when they interact with your\h
detector, the wave collapses and\h\h

871
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:47,280
the electron is at a precise spot.
Experimental evidence was quickly sought\h\h

872
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:55,240
to see if this picture was correct,
And it didn’t take long to arrive.

873
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:02,160
The experimental setup was similar to\h
Young’s famous double-slit experiment,\h

874
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:08,160
Where light was shone through two slits and\h
showed the unmistakable patterns of interference.\h

875
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:14,080
This demonstrated that light travelled as a wave,\h
as you need waves to construct interference.\h

876
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:19,040
And if quantum matter behaves like\h
waves, it should show interference too!

877
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,680
The idea was to fire a beam of\h
electrons onto a target of nickel,\h\h

878
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:26,680
with a regular pattern of atoms.
If the electrons were little bullets,\h\h

879
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:30,760
we would expect them to randomly\h
ricochet off the target atoms,\h

880
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,880
However, the experimenters found\h
that there were certain directions\h\h

881
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:39,960
in which electrons preferred to recoil,
And other recoil paths that they seemed to avoid.

882
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:45,600
This was the unmistakable pattern of interference,\h
places where waves added and strengthened,\h

883
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,160
And others where the waves\h
cancelled each other out.

884
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:54,520
To help understand this, imagine you\h
are a sharpshooter at the Olympics.\h

885
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:58,600
Through your sights, you zero in on\h
your target a hundred metres away.\h

886
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,560
You line up your crosshairs,\h
take a deep breath and hold it.\h

887
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:08,280
But as you think about your glory yet\h
to come, your mind starts pondering.\h

888
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:12,600
What if you were a sharpshooter\h
in the quantum world?

889
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:17,280
In the quantum world, the certainty\h
of everyday physics melts away.\h

890
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,760
Instead of exact locations and velocity,\h\h

891
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,360
your bullet is now governed by\h
the rules of quantum probability,\h

892
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:28,000
And when you squeeze the trigger, the bullet\h
emerges from the barrel as a quantum wave,\h

893
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,160
Spreading out in all directions\h
like the ripples of water on a pond.

894
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:37,440
This quantum wave travels quite differently\h
to the zipping path of the bullet,\h

895
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:42,520
Quantum waves can diffract around corners,\h
and can interfere with other quantum waves,\h

896
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:47,160
A spray of quantum bullets would not result\h
in a grouping of holes in the target,\h

897
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:53,800
Instead, a pattern of interference would\h
emerge, with some bullets here and none there.

898
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:57,000
This strange mix of wavelike and\h
particle-like properties in the\h\h

899
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,280
quantum world is known as a duality,
And quite why we don’t experience\h\h

900
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:05,400
this in everyday life remains a mystery,
Though physicists have been able to see\h\h

901
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:09,080
the effect of quantum waves even\h
on the scale of large molecules,\h

902
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:15,480
Many tens of atoms travelling together as\h
a quantum wave and showing interference.

903
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:19,800
And so experiments showed,\h
precisely as Born had suggested,\h\h

904
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:23,080
the waves of the electrons\h
were combining and cancelling,\h

905
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:28,120
But bizarrely their detectors were counting\h
just individual electrons arriving.\h

906
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:35,560
Quantum objects were definitively travelling as\h
waves but interacting with detectors as particles.

907
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:40,400
Indeed, as further proof, today we use this\h
fact in our most powerful of microscopes.\h

908
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:44,600
Instead of a beam of light, these focus\h
a beam of electrons onto a target,\h

909
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:47,240
And use the wave properties of the beam to reveal\h\h

910
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:52,254
details beyond that visible to light.

911
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:55,920
Born received his Nobel\h
Prize in nineteen fifty-four,\h\h

912
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,880
one year before Einstein’s death.
But in the decades in between,\h\h

913
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:04,000
Einstein had become a vocal critic of\h
this probabilistic picture of nature,\h

914
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:09,200
convinced as he was that it could not be\h
the way that the universe actually worked.\h

915
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:15,440
Whilst Einstein and Born were friends,\h
they never saw eye to eye on reality.

916
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:19,760
Einstein was horrified by probability\h
sitting at the heart of our world.\h

917
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:23,960
He felt that the universe must\h
be deterministic at its heart.\h

918
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:27,120
Though he accepted that quantum\h
mechanics could be probabilistic,\h

919
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,640
He believed there was something deeper,\h\h

920
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:34,240
something hidden beneath the quantum\h
world that clung to determinism.

921
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:39,280
Indeed, in a now iconic letter to\h
Born, Einstein outlined his sentiment:

922
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:44,200
"I, at any rate, am convinced\h
that [God] does not throw dice.”

923
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:49,440
By nineteen thirty-five, Einstein had fled\h
his native Germany and arrived in the USA.\h

924
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:53,880
And it was there he wrote about a paradox\h
at the heart of quantum mechanics,\h

925
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:59,360
A paradox he was convinced would demonstrate\h
the absurdity of some of its big ideas.\h

926
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,280
And this paradox, almost a century old,\h\h

927
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:08,600
is still key to our modern\h
understanding of the quantum world.

928
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:13,800
It is known as the EPR paradox, after its\h
authors, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen.\h

929
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:18,120
And it highlighted one of Einstein's\h
biggest problems with quantum mechanics -\h

930
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:22,760
the apparently instantaneous collapse of\h
the probability waves, through observation,\h\h

931
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,480
into particles.
 
And to understand this,\h

932
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:30,720
Let’s start with thinking\h
about two quantum particles.

933
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:35,400
One of the interesting things about the\h
wavefunction is that when we have two particles,\h

934
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:42,680
The wavefunction for both is not simply the sum of\h
the wavefunctions of the individual wavefunctions.\h

935
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:48,720
No - a new wavefunction can be written that\h
encapsulates the properties of the two particles.\h

936
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:54,840
And it’s this combined wavefunction\h
that gave Einstein a headache.

937
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,040
Imagine the two particles are brought\h
into existence through some event.\h

938
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,320
The details of the event are unimportant,\h\h

939
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:08,240
but results in the particles\h
having linked quantum values.\h

940
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:15,000
For example, imagine the particles are born with\h
quantum spin, one spinning up, one spinning down.\h

941
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:21,240
This way the total spin is equal to zero, so\h
spin has been conserved in their creation.

942
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:27,280
Except the wavefunction does not contain\h
definite information, just probabilities.\h

943
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,240
So, each particle has a fifty per\h
cent chance of spinning upwards,\h\h

944
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:36,440
and a fifty per cent chance of downwards.
However an important rule of the universe\h\h

945
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:41,080
is that the total spin is conserved - so\h
if you detect one is spinning upwards,\h

946
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:45,160
The other absolutely MUST be\h
definitely spinning downwards.

947
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:49,760
In Einstein’s thought experiment, you can imagine\h
the particles separating after their creation,\h

948
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:53,640
And moving an immense distance\h
apart, maybe several light years.\h

949
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:59,600
They are travelling as waves, and you don’t\h
know the orientation of either particle’s spin.\h

950
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,320
Everything is still a mix of probability.

951
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,000
Imagine one of the particles\h
runs into a spin detector.\h

952
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,360
With a loud beep it registers the spin\h
and the display reads SPIN UPWARDS.\h

953
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:21,240
You now know that the spin of the other\h
particle is definitely spin downwards,\h

954
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:26,360
The wavefunction must have collapsed into\h
the definite states of the particles.

955
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,720
But herein lies the problem.

956
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:35,880
How does this pair of widely separated particles\h
know that one has had its spin determined?\h

957
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:41,440
Does the wavefunction, which is strung between\h
the two particles, collapse instantaneously?\h

958
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:50,880
If it did, Einstein said, then this collapse\h
would occur faster than the speed of light,\h

959
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,680
And that, of course, was forbidden\h
by his special theory of relativity.\h

960
01:18:53,680 --> 01:19:01,080
Nothing in the universe can travel faster than\h
the speed of light, under any circumstances.

961
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:06,240
The solution, claimed Einstein, is that\h
quantum mechanics simply could not be complete.\h

962
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:10,000
That underlying its apparently\h
probabilistic façade lurked\h\h

963
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,600
something else, something definite and\h
certain that we simply hadn't found yet.

964
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,760
These “hidden” variables would\h\h

965
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:23,680
be solid and deterministic values\h
precisely describing a situation.\h

966
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:30,360
And it would be these hidden values that\h
described the true nature of reality.

967
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:36,280
The hunt for these hidden variables was on,
Einstein and de Broglie put new ideas on the\h\h

968
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:41,120
table, then eventually threw them in the bin.
Others sought a solution to the EPR paradox which\h\h

969
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:46,200
brought determinism back to the heart of reality,
But by the nineteen sixties, all attempts were\h\h

970
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:54,800
dashed by the insights of an\h
Irish physicist in Switzerland.

971
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,600
John Stewart Bell was born in\h\h

972
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:00,120
Belfast in nineteen twenty eight.
From a young age, he had decided\h\h

973
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:03,560
that he wanted to be a scientist,
And in nineteen sixty, he found\h\h

974
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:07,640
himself as a theoretical physicist\h
working on the Swiss French Border.\h

975
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:14,760
At the recently formed European Organization\h
for Nuclear Research, or CERN for short.

976
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:18,880
Bell contributed many things to physics\h
and the understanding of reality,\h

977
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:23,480
But he is probably best remembered for\h
what is known as the Bell inequalities.\h

978
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:27,160
His thought experiment was similar\h
to that laid out in the EPR paradox,\h

979
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:30,680
But with a subtle and insightful twist.

980
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:32,480
Just like in the EPR paradox,\h\h

981
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:37,440
we first make a pair of particles that\h
are entangled in their wavefunction,\h

982
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:42,480
Then we allow them to separate to a large\h
distance where each encounters a detector.\h

983
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:48,120
The detector can register spin up or spin\h
down, but each can be oriented differently.\h

984
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:52,680
But let’s start by imagining the\h
two detectors are perfectly aligned.

985
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:59,000
As we have seen before, if one detector\h
registers an up, the other must register a down.\h

986
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,680
The readings on one detector might be\h
up, up, down, up, down, down, down.\h

987
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:07,960
The other must read down,\h
down, up, down, up, up, up.\h

988
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,960
The readings are perfectly correlated.

989
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:16,480
Bell’s twist was to consider what would\h
happen if the two detectors were not aligned.\h

990
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:22,480
What if one was set to register up-down and\h
the other was twisted to measure left-right?\h

991
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,840
This might sound like a\h
strange thing to do, because\h\h

992
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:30,280
if a particle is spinning either up or down,
How could it register any spin left or right?

993
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:35,560
If you are thinking like this, you are still\h
considering the particles as classical things.\h

994
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:40,680
As if they are truly solid balls that\h
contain a definite direction of spin.\h

995
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:46,040
But remember, they are not – they\h
are purely quantum particles,\h\h

996
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,720
and their spins are probabilistic.\h

997
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:54,520
So, there will be some probability of spin\h
up-down, and some probability of left-right.

998
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:58,360
Though thinking like this can\h
start to bring on a headache,\h\h

999
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:01,840
it is the way the microscopic world works.

1000
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:05,320
Bell started to wonder about\h
the correlations of the outputs.\h

1001
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:09,400
With one detector reading\h
up, down, down, down, up, up.\h

1002
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:13,040
And the other right, right, right, left, right.

1003
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:17,880
He was able to conclude that if these\h
choices are being made by hidden variables,\h

1004
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:21,640
By definite quantities tied\h
to each of the particles,\h\h

1005
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:25,560
a particular pattern of\h
correlations should be seen.\h

1006
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:32,800
And if there are no hidden variables, so Einstein\h
was wrong, a different pattern should emerge.\h

1007
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:38,920
And so the rush to experimentally\h
test Bell’s experiment was underway.

1008
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:44,120
It wasn’t long until the first\h
results were on the table.

1009
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:50,080
Calcium atoms were excited in a hot oven,\h
emitting two correlated photons as they cooled.\h

1010
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:54,520
These photons zipped out of the oven and\h
into the physicists’ detectors, who then\h\h

1011
01:22:54,520 --> 01:23:00,600
compared the polarizations of the photons, the\h
vibrat ional direction of the electric field.\h

1012
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:04,720
Bell said that if there were hidden\h
variables defining the photons,\h\h

1013
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:09,360
specific correlations would be measured.
But if there were not, and the photons’\h\h

1014
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:12,080
properties were spread over\h
the quantum wave function,\h

1015
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:16,080
Then a distinctly different set of\h
correlations would be measured.
 \h

1016
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:21,120
The results were conclusive,\h
there could be no variables,\h

1017
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:27,680
Reality was not a property of things but was\h
non-local, extended over the quantum waves,\h

1018
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:32,720
And as the many experiments undertaken ever\h
since further confirmed this conclusion,\h

1019
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:42,680
Einstein’s notion that the underlying universe\h
was deterministic was quietly put to bed.

1020
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:47,880
And so at this point, you might\h
be wondering what all this means.\h

1021
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:53,960
This seems like a minor academic argument about\h
some exotic quantum stuff in weird experiments.

1022
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:59,375
But the ramifications for\h
reality are, however, huge,\h

1023
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:05,080
Locality has always been a key concept in physics.
What it means is that something responds purely\h\h

1024
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:10,400
to its local environment.
Proximity is important.\h

1025
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:13,600
A mass responds directly\h
to a force acting upon it,\h

1026
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:20,240
But it does not know or care about a\h
force acting on another mass far away.

1027
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:24,640
It is the non-local nature of quantum\h
mechanics that Einstein objected to,\h

1028
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:28,640
That a particle detection in one part\h
of the universe can influence the\h\h

1029
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:34,760
properties of another elsewhere.
In a letter to Max Born in 1947,\h\h

1030
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:39,960
Einstein referred to this as spukhafte\h
fernwirkungen - “spooky action at a\h\h

1031
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:46,520
distance” and this was a step too far\h
for Einstein’s view of the universe.

1032
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:50,760
And what this means when extropolated is baffling.

1033
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:55,000
An electron is not simply an electron,
And neither is any other\h\h

1034
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:00,440
fundamental particle in the universe.
Particles must be entangled with others,\h\h

1035
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:07,400
sharing their experiences across the universe,
No individual thing is simply a thing.

1036
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:15,800
Everything, universe wide, is truly connected.

1037
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:20,600
You might be sharing Einstein’s\h
feeling that this is a step too far.,\h

1038
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:24,760
that there is no way your apple is entangled\h
with other particles in the cosmos.\h

1039
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:29,920
But we have to remember that the universe\h
simply does not care about your feelings,\h\h

1040
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:34,120
your intuition, what you\h
can process in your brain.
 \h

1041
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:38,480
It refuses to behave in a way\h
that you think is sensible.

1042
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:46,240
And the award of the 2022 Nobel Prize in\h
Physics demonstrates this cosmic absurdity.\h

1043
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:50,240
The laureates were Alan Aspect, John\h
Clauser, and Anton Zellinger and the\h\h

1044
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:55,000
subject was entangled photons.
Experimenting over decades,\h\h

1045
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,000
these physicists showed that widely\h
separate particles behave as one,\h

1046
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:05,780
The goal was to dismiss any prospect of there\h
being any hidden variables defining reality.

1047
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:11,920
And a recent example of these experiments, the\h
Cosmic Bell Test, might be the most extreme.\h

1048
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:16,160
The worry was that experiments to\h
reveal Bell’s correlations might\h\h

1049
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:21,000
not be quite telling us the truth.
Experiments are built of atoms,\h\h

1050
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,320
and what if all these particles had\h
interacted throughout their long histories?\h

1051
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:31,720
And worse than that, the experimenters themselves\h
were made of similarly entangled particles too!

1052
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:34,680
When physicists set up their\h
experiments, they like to\h\h

1053
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:40,760
think they are distinctly separate from them.
They think they are but objective observers, just\h\h

1054
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:46,600
looking at the outcomes of the laws of physics.
The equipment in their lab is, in their minds,\h\h

1055
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,760
effectively isolated from\h
the rest of the universe,\h

1056
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,920
And what they see is just the outcome\h
of the physics in front of them.

1057
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:59,800
However, this is not quite the case. The\h
experimental apparatus is made of atoms,\h

1058
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:03,800
Atoms that have a history much\h
older than the experiment itself.\h

1059
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:09,600
The physicists too are made of atoms,\h
atoms with a history much older than them.\h

1060
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:15,040
Atoms that have been around for\h
billions and billions of years.

1061
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:20,600
Over these billions of years, there have been\h
countless opportunities for these atoms to tangle,\h

1062
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:27,080
And in these interactions, any hidden variables\h
could have been rewritten and correlated.\h

1063
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:30,800
This would mean that the correlations\h
the physicists measure could simply\h\h

1064
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:37,640
be a result of the atoms' long history,
Rather than the physics being non-local.

1065
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:41,640
This had the potential to introduce\h
quantum loopholes into the experiment.\h

1066
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:47,360
And physicists wondered if hidden variables were\h
colluding to make it look like they didn’t exist.\h

1067
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,640
They needed to set the settings of\h
the experiment in a way that could\h\h

1068
01:27:50,640 --> 01:28:04,920
not be influenced by Earthly ways,
And so, they looked to the skies.

1069
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:11,280
They set up their experiment as usual, and then\h
they brought in the light of two distant stars,\h

1070
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:17,920
The starlight fluctuated slightly, and these\h
fluctuations became part of the experiment.\h

1071
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:24,160
These flutterings were used to set the\h
orientations at which the spins were measured.
 \h

1072
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:29,960
And again, the experiment revealed\h
that reality must be non-local.

1073
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:35,840
Remarkably, these experiments were even repeated\h
using cosmological quasars rather than stars,\h

1074
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:42,040
Pushing the possibility of a hidden variable\h
loophole occuring back almost 8 billion years to\h\h

1075
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:46,760
the time of these extremely bright galaxies.
Again, the spins of the particles were\h\h

1076
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:51,400
explored at orientations set by the\h
fluctuating light of the quasars,\h

1077
01:28:51,400 --> 01:29:04,880
And again, the results were unequivocal – reality\h
must be non-local - it is not simply there.

1078
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:12,840
Again, you look over and spy your apple,
And again, you begin to wonder.

1079
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:18,760
Your mind can handle the fact that your apple is,\h
at heart, a collection of fundamental particles.\h

1080
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:23,760
And it feels sensible that they are\h
there, part of the fruit you can see.\h

1081
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,720
But these particles are entangled with each\h
other, and with others in the universe.\h

1082
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:35,000
And it seems that the apple is actually\h
spookily entwined with the cosmos.

1083
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,800
And so now the question, is why?

1084
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:45,160
Why exactly is this apple, and\h
this universe, so connected?

1085
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:55,040
What are the rules that run beneath everything?
________________\h

1086
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:06,680
On the eighteenth of April, nineteen\h
fifty-five, the old man died.\h

1087
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:09,920
He was born in Germany\h
almost eight decades earlier,\h\h

1088
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,880
but his last moments were in an American hospital.\h

1089
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:17,440
His final words were in his native\h
tongue, but these are lost to posterity,\h

1090
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:21,880
As his nurse who was caring for him was\h
unfamiliar with the German language.

1091
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:27,880
But in the hours before his death, the man\h
had asked for three things - his glasses,\h\h

1092
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:34,160
his writing equipment and his equations\h
- to work on one final problem.

1093
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:39,400
This man, Albert Einstein, is considered\h
one of the greatest physicists of all time,\h

1094
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:44,080
And his name is splashed across the\h
pages of the textbooks of modern physics.\h

1095
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:49,040
But later in his life, his work had\h
become focused on a single question,\h

1096
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:53,920
A question that still haunts physicists today.

1097
01:30:54,760 --> 01:31:00,280
Two central theories emerged from the revolution\h
of the first decades of the twentieth century.\h

1098
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:02,760
We have met them both in our story so far,\h

1099
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:06,760
Einstein’s relativity described the\h
actions of gravity across the cosmos,\h

1100
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:11,000
While quantum mechanics explained\h
the universe of the subatomic.

1101
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,480
Quantum mechanics was refined\h
throughout the twentieth century,\h

1102
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:18,520
Evolving into what is now\h
known as quantum field theory.\h

1103
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:23,400
It is these fields that contain the rippling\h
waves of probability in quantum mechanics,\h

1104
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:28,120
And it is these fields that describe\h
the physics of the fundamental pieces,\h\h

1105
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:30,800
like electrons and quarks.

1106
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,920
We have also already encountered the\h
standard model of particle physics,\h

1107
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:44,520
And this is really a theory about the\h
interaction of these quantum fields.

1108
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,960
When two charged particles, like electrons,\h\h

1109
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:51,320
interact, they create vibrations\h
in the electromagnetic field.\h

1110
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:56,280
And these vibrations, the carriers of the\h
electromagnetic force, are the photons.\h

1111
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:59,960
And of course the electrons themselves\h
are also just vibrations - vibrations in\h\h

1112
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:04,360
the electron field - just as each type of\h
quark that makes up neutrons and protons\h\h

1113
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:09,680
are vibrations in their own quark fields,\h
and so on and so on for other particles.

1114
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:13,760
There are also other fields\h
for other fundamental forces.\h

1115
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:19,160
The strong force is responsible for holding\h
the quarks in protons and neutrons together,\h

1116
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:23,440
And for binding these particles\h
in the nuclei of atoms.\h

1117
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:29,720
Vibrations in the strong field are the\h
gluons, the carriers of the strong force.

1118
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:35,160
There are also fields associated with the weak\h
force, responsible for aspects of radioactivity.\h

1119
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:42,800
And their vibrations correspond to\h
what are known as the W and Z bosons.\h

1120
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:49,280
For every force, there is a vibration in a\h
field, and that vibration is a quantum particle.

1121
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:53,480
To understand this, let’s take\h
a look at the life of a neutron.\h

1122
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:57,280
Left on its own, a free neutron\h
will decay in about fifteen minutes,\h

1123
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:02,280
Transforming into a proton and spitting\h
out an electron and a ghostly neutrino.\h

1124
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:07,560
But just what is happening in\h
terms of the quantum fields?

1125
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:14,080
Remember that a neutron is a collection of\h
three quarks, two down quarks and an up quark.\h

1126
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:19,200
These are constantly generating vibrations\h
in the strong field, with gluons flying\h\h

1127
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:23,040
about and binding the neutron.
But the weak field is still there,\h\h

1128
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:27,080
and eventually one of the quarks\h
will pluck a new vibration in it.\h

1129
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:34,080
And one of the down quarks will transform into\h
an up quark, turning the neutron into a proton.

1130
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:40,840
The ripple in the weak field represents a W minus\h
boson and flies from the newly formed proton.\h

1131
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:43,640
But this particle lives\h
for only a very short time,\h\h

1132
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:47,000
less than a billionth of a second,
And as its vibration vanishes,\h\h

1133
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:53,280
it produces vibrations in new fields,\h
creating an electron and neutrino.\h

1134
01:33:53,280 --> 01:34:04,960
All quantum particle interactions can\h
be described in exactly the same way.

1135
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:09,200
One other quantum field is\h
necessary to round off the picture,\h

1136
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:15,600
Perhaps the most famous quantum\h
field of all, the Higgs field.\h

1137
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:19,520
Interactions with the Higgs field give\h
mass to the fundamental particles,\h

1138
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,480
The vibrations represent the Higgs boson,\h\h

1139
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:26,000
discovered in twenty twelve\h
after a four-decade search.

1140
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,680
It was in the early nineteen sixties that\h
physicists realised that there was a problem.\h

1141
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:37,360
As we know, the weak force has two associated\h
particles, bosons known as the W and Z,\h

1142
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:39,960
Quantum field theory, the theory that\h
describes quantum forces, requires force\h\h

1143
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:43,640
particles to be massless.
For electromagnetism,\h\h

1144
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:47,280
the force particle is the\h
photon, a massless particle,\h

1145
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:53,040
And for the strong force, the force particle\h
is the gluon, again a massless particle.\h

1146
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:59,280
So why, physicists asked, did the W\h
and Z of the weak force have mass?

1147
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:03,360
Simply adding mass to the W and Z\h
in the equations proved a disaster,\h

1148
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:07,040
As quickly the mathematical\h
terms exploded to infinities,\h

1149
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:12,120
So it was a new mechanism that would\h
be needed to add mass to the W and Z,\h

1150
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:18,200
And this mechanism was provided by the Higgs field\h
- a field of energy that permeates all of space,

1151
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:21,840
The W and Z particles feel the\h
presence of the Higgs field,\h\h

1152
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,960
coupling through a quantum interaction,\h

1153
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:27,720
Whilst the photon and the gluon\h
don’t see the Higgs field at all.\h

1154
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:31,160
The problem of the masses of\h
the W and Z bosons was solved,\h

1155
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:35,320
But it was realised that the Higgs\h
mechanism had more up its sleeve.

1156
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:39,680
It was quickly seen that the mechanism that\h
gave the weak force particles their mass,\h

1157
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:44,440
Could give mass to all of the fundamental\h
particles, to all the electrons and quarks,\h

1158
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:48,480
As these particles travel through\h
the seeming emptiness of space,\h

1159
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:53,640
The presence of the Higgs field\h
ensures they have just the right mass.

1160
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:00,800
Quantum field theory is highly successful,\h\h

1161
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:04,240
accurately predicting what is\h
spat out of particle experiments.\h

1162
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:10,320
Electrons, quarks, sprays of gluons and many\h
other wonders can be found in its mathematics.\h

1163
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:16,600
Einstein’s relativity is equally successful,\h
predicting the motions of objects in the heavens.\h

1164
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:23,560
But the superb accuracy of both these\h
theories is where Einstein’s headaches began.

1165
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:29,480
Whilst Einstein did not have the details\h
of the fundamental forces available today,\h

1166
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:34,520
He did realise the problem in\h
the language of the two theories.\h

1167
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:39,640
Relativity described gravity in\h
terms of curved and warped spacetime,\h

1168
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:44,880
Quantum field theory, on the other\h
hand, spoke about probability and waves.

1169
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:48,040
These two languages were\h
completely at odds with each other.\h

1170
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:53,880
You might wonder So what? Does it really\h
matter if we need two sets of mathematics?\h

1171
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:59,400
But to physicists like Einstein, this flew\h
in the face of the dream of modern physics,\h

1172
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:03,040
The dream of unification.

1173
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:08,080
It started with James Clerk Maxwell\h
and his work on electromagnetism.\h

1174
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:14,040
In one set of equations, he showed that the two\h
disparate phenomena, electricity and magnetism,\h

1175
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:17,600
Are just two sides of a single coin.

1176
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:22,080
With the advent of the quantum field\h
theory, things became simpler again.\h

1177
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:28,640
Three of the fundamental forces, electromagnetism,\h
strong and weak, could be written in its language.\h

1178
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:33,200
One mathematical formalism to\h
encompass seemingly diverse phenomena,\h

1179
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:37,720
It all worked so well – except for gravity.

1180
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:42,400
Gravity simply did not fit.

1181
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,200
Soon after the appearance of general relativity,\h\h

1182
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:48,920
physicists wondered if extra\h
dimensions were the answer.\h

1183
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:54,760
What if spacetime had more dimensions, and\h
these contained the electromagnetic force?\h

1184
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:58,400
These ideas appeared to sort\h
of work, but very imperfectly,\h

1185
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:03,120
And of course left a big question,\h
namely where are these extra dimensions?

1186
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:09,760
Surely, we would notice if there were more than\h
up-down, left-right and back-front in space.
 \h

1187
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:16,040
But physicists offered a novel solution – what\h
if these dimensions were curled up tightly,\h

1188
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:19,080
So tightly in fact that we\h
could have no experience\h\h

1189
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:26,440
of their existence, no way to resolve them,
Like using boxing gloves to put together lego.

1190
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:35,160
Reality, some thought, could be built from a\h
large number of these curled-up dimensions.

1191
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:40,480
These ideas languished for several decades,\h
but in the nineteen sixties saw a rebirth.\h

1192
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:45,840
Physicists realised that these curled-up\h
dimensions could encompass all of the forces,\h

1193
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:52,800
But only if we treat fundamental particles\h
as loops of string instead of points.

1194
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:57,240
The string theory revolution had begun.

1195
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:58,800
Into the nineteen eighties and nineties,\h\h

1196
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:02,240
physicists were sure that\h
they were on the right path.\h

1197
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:07,640
Any day, someone could crack the formidable\h
mathematics, and everything would fall into place.\h

1198
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:12,480
But as they toiled in the more than\h
twenty dimensions needed for their theory,\h

1199
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:19,520
The fog of physics refused to lift, and\h
unification seemed as distant as ever.

1200
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:23,360
More recently, string theory\h
has morphed into M-theory,\h

1201
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:27,000
The M in the title left open by its\h
originator Edward Witten for when\h\h

1202
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:33,160
whatever M-theory truly is reveals itself.
Strings have been replaced with membranes,\h\h

1203
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:37,000
so that might be the answer -
But in reality it is a loose\h\h

1204
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:42,040
collection of mathematical ideas,\h
themselves looking for unification.

1205
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:44,880
Not everyone has been bitten\h
by the string theory bug,\h

1206
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:49,720
And others have hunted for mathematical\h
structures that could underpin reality.\h

1207
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:54,320
Loop quantum gravity is one\h
such idea, knitting reality from\h\h

1208
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:58,920
fundamental chunks of space and time.
But it too has proven mathematically\h\h

1209
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:08,760
challenging and has yet to prove\h
itself as the unifying theory.

1210
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:15,680
But physicists are resilient and the hunt for\h
the ultimate theory of everything continues.\h

1211
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:20,840
New mathematical ideas are proposed and\h
tested, before usually being rejected,

1212
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:26,440
And to guide their search, physicists rely on\h
one of the key concepts in physics to guide them.\h

1213
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:32,000
A concept that comes as close to the ultimate\h
rule of the universe as anything else does:

1214
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,840
The idea of symmetry.

1215
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,560
We all have a passing notion of symmetry - things\h\h

1216
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:42,680
like a vase or a building\h
being pleasing to the eye.\h

1217
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:45,880
But you can use mathematics\h
to talk about symmetries,\h

1218
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:52,640
And the existence of these symmetries has a\h
profound impact on the nature of our reality.

1219
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:59,160
Take, for example, a sphere, a shape\h
we can define precisely in mathematics.\h

1220
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:02,280
If we rotate a sphere, it\h
still looks like a sphere.\h

1221
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:07,040
The sphere has rotational symmetry, a\h
change that does not alter its appearance,\h

1222
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:13,264
And we can explore the mathematics of\h
physics to search for similar symmetries.

1223
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:17,400
Because, as Emmy Noether showed\h
in nineteen fifteen, every\h\h

1224
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:21,560
symmetry implies a conservation law.

1225
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:23,240
But what does this mean?

1226
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:35,040
Imagine you have a physics experiment,\h
something like rolling balls down a slope.\h

1227
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:39,400
And imagine you spend a while rolling\h
balls and measuring their speeds.\h

1228
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:44,840
Now imagine you move your physics experiment by\h
a metre left or right and repeat the rolling.\h

1229
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:51,120
Would you expect the outcome to be the same\h
or different? Surely it would be the same.

1230
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:57,680
So, moving the experiment didn’t change\h
the outcome, and this is a symmetry.\h

1231
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:01,480
But what is the conserved\h
quantity that this implies?\h

1232
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:06,720
The mathematics of Noether tell us\h
that the conserved thing is momentum,\h

1233
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:10,560
This property of motion, mass\h
times velocity in Newton’s theory,\h\h

1234
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:14,320
is conserved because of this symmetry.

1235
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:17,400
Momentum cannot simply disappear\h
in a physical interaction,\h\h

1236
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:23,240
simply vanish - one billiard ball\h
transfers its energy to another.

1237
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:26,800
Other symmetries exist and\h
imply other conservation laws.\h

1238
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:31,480
If you rotate your experiment by ninety\h
degrees and repeat the rolling of the balls,\h

1239
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:34,800
Again, you expect the same\h
outcome of your experiments,\h

1240
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:41,080
Now the conserved quantity is angular momentum,\h
the conservation of spin in the universe.

1241
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:45,080
But perhaps the strangest symmetry\h
is that associated with time,\h

1242
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:51,280
The fact that if you perform your experiment today\h
and then tomorrow, you expect the same results.\h

1243
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:57,720
This time symmetry results in what seems like one\h
of the most fundamental rules about the universe.\h

1244
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:03,520
This time symmetry implies\h
the conservation of energy.\h

1245
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:07,840
Energy itself cannot be lost or created.

1246
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:11,520
Symmetries run deep through our\h
ideas of theoretical physics.\h

1247
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:15,320
Einstein’s special relativity\h
is built entirely on symmetries,\h

1248
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:19,560
And it can be derived from what is known\h
as the Lorentz group of symmetries.\h

1249
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:25,480
Indeed it is these symmetries that demand that\h
the speed of light is the fastest speed there is!

1250
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:34,920
But it is in quantum mechanics\h
that symmetries reign supreme.
 \h

1251
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:41,120
It was realised that electromagnetism contained\h
a symmetry, unexcitingly known as u one,\h

1252
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:47,280
And that other symmetry groups, with more esoteric\h
names, described the strong and weak forces.\h

1253
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:50,720
With these symmetry groups\h
come new conserved quantities.\h

1254
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:54,880
For electromagnetism, the quantity\h
that is conserved is charge.\h

1255
01:43:54,880 --> 01:44:00,840
But for the other forces, other quantum numbers\h
appear, quantities that seem quite unfamiliar,\h

1256
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:05,960
Isospin, lepton number, quark\h
numbers and a host of others.

1257
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:12,960
These all represent the rule book of\h
reality, defining what can and cannot happen.\h

1258
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:17,200
If the conservation laws hold,\h
then interactions can occur.\h

1259
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:21,080
If they are broken, then\h
interactions are strictly forbidden.\h

1260
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:27,320
Deep deep down - reality appears\h
to be built on symmetries.

1261
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:30,720
And in the search for even deeper reality,\h\h

1262
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:36,200
physicists have tried to incorporate\h
more and more proposed symmetries.

1263
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:41,200
With supersymmetry, physicists try to\h
hold up a mirror to the standard model,\h

1264
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:46,160
Reflecting all existing fundamental\h
particles with supersymmetric counterparts.\h

1265
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:53,240
For electrons, there should also be selectrons,\h
for photons there should be photinos and so on.\h

1266
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:57,400
Supersymmetry improves the mathematical\h
elegance of the standard model,\h

1267
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:01,280
And for some, it indicates the\h
true path to enlightenment,\h

1268
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:07,200
But there has been no sign yet of any of the\h
supersymmetric particles in any experiment.\h

1269
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:12,800
This, many claim, shows that\h
supersymmetry as an idea is dead.

1270
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:17,560
Groups of symmetries also sit at the\h
heart of string theories and M-theories,\h

1271
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:22,960
And different symmetries are used to\h
clean up and clarify loop quantum gravity.

1272
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:32,360
Clues keep coming from geometry and symmetry,
With many putting their faith in what is called\h\h

1273
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:38,360
the anti-de Sitter/conformal\h
field theory correspondence.

1274
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:45,160
This mouthful, usually abbreviated as AdS/CFT,\h
was found by Juan Maldacena in the late nineties.\h

1275
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:52,360
A mathematical mapping between aspects of string\h
theory containing gravity and particle theories,\h

1276
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:57,400
It showed that the mathematics of one particular\h
4 dimensional universe without gravity,\h\h

1277
01:45:57,400 --> 01:46:03,680
a universe built on quantum mechanics alone,\h
could match that of a 5 dimensional universe\h\h

1278
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:10,440
with gravity. In short - that there was a clear\h
mathematical link between the two - gravity and

1279
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:14,920
Immense effort has been placed in uncovering\h\h

1280
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:18,000
whether this correspondence\h
tells us something deeper,\h

1281
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:23,160
Perhaps a shadow of the true theory\h
of everything that rules reality.

1282
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:30,508
However the AdS/CFT correspondence could\h
also have very bizarre implications.

1283
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:34,160
You might be familiar with the\h
notion of an optical hologram,\h

1284
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:38,600
Where a three-dimensional image is\h
encoded in a two-dimensional space.\h

1285
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:42,760
One of the possible consequences\h
of the Ads/CFT correspondence is\h\h

1286
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:48,120
that this may be the case for reality.
What we experience as reality really just\h\h

1287
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:51,920
a projection of information\h
stored in lower dimensions\h

1288
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:54,520
And just like an optical hologram is nothing\h\h

1289
01:46:54,520 --> 01:47:03,360
but an illusion conjured up\h
from a two-dimensional plane.

1290
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:10,240
This notion, known as the holographic principle,\h
grew out of our understanding of black holes.

1291
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:13,360
Black holes are extremely simple objects,\h\h

1292
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:18,360
completely described by only their\h
mass, angular momentum, and charge.\h

1293
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:22,480
A black hole carries no memory of\h
the objects that have ever fallen in,\h

1294
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:27,080
All information, other than those three\h
properties, is seemingly forgotten.

1295
01:47:27,080 --> 01:47:33,840
But in physics, it is generally accepted that\h
information cannot be created or destroyed,\h

1296
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:37,480
Only processed from one form\h
of information into another.\h

1297
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:42,680
So, for black holes, the question of just where\h
all of their information goes was problematic.

1298
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:49,280
Originally, it was suggested that the information\h
is still there, encased in the black hole’s heart.\h

1299
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:55,080
Here, it would just be hidden from the rest\h
of the universe, out of sight and out of mind.\h

1300
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:59,880
But in the early nineteen seventies,\h
this picture was completely demolished,\h

1301
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:06,560
Destroyed by the insights of a young\h
physicist named Stephen Hawking.

1302
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:11,280
Hawking had wondered about the impact\h
of quantum mechanics near a black hole.\h

1303
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:15,920
He eventually showed that the one-way\h
influence of the event horizon,\h\h

1304
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:18,200
which allows things in but nothing out,\h

1305
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:22,160
Conjured particles out of the\h
foaming quantum background.\h

1306
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:27,320
These particles escaped into the\h
universe, carrying energy with them.

1307
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:31,280
But from where did these particles’ energy arise?

1308
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:34,360
Hawking’s solution was astounding.\h

1309
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:39,200
He suggested that the energy was seemingly\h
tapped from the mass of the black holes,\h

1310
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:43,720
And as the particles escaped, the mass\h
of the black hole steadily decreases,\h

1311
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:47,920
Until it has completely\h
evaporated away to nothing.

1312
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,400
But that wasn't the end.

1313
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:53,040
For if the black hole’s\h
information was written inside it,\h\h

1314
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:57,600
where did it go as the black hole evaporated?
It didn’t appear to be written onto the\h\h

1315
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:00,880
particles that were ejected,
And physicists couldn't accept\h\h

1316
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:06,720
that the information had been erased,
So they hunted for another solution.

1317
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:10,640
What if the information was not\h
carried into the black hole,\h\h

1318
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:15,240
but instead was left elsewhere?
Perhaps, they suggested,\h\h

1319
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:20,960
information was imprinted instead on the\h
event horizon as things fell through.\h

1320
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:26,160
This information could then be etched onto the\h
escaping particles as the black hole evaporates,\h

1321
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:33,080
With the total information released into the\h
universe as the black hole totally disappeared.

1322
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:36,960
In this picture, the black hole\h
is a three-dimensional object,\h\h

1323
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:41,640
filling three-dimensional space,
But it stores its information on a\h\h

1324
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:46,680
two-dimensional surface, the event horizon.
In the same way,\h\h

1325
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:54,680
a hologram holds a three-dimensional image,
All encoded into a two-dimensional surface.

1326
01:49:54,680 --> 01:50:02,760
And some physicists have suggested the\h
entire universe is structured the same way.

1327
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:08,400
Before we leave the importance of symmetry in\h
physics, there is one more thing to explore,\h

1328
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:14,320
And that is the fact that the symmetries\h
of our universe cannot be totally perfect.\h

1329
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:18,440
Some of the symmetries have to\h
be imperfect, have to be cracked,\h

1330
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:22,840
For if they weren’t, we would not be here.

1331
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:28,600
Take, for example, the asymmetry\h
of matter in the cosmos.

1332
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:31,960
The universe appears to be\h
stuffed with electrons, many\h\h

1333
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:38,440
orbiting atoms, some just floating out in space,
But their anti-matter counterparts, the positrons,\h\h

1334
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:45,000
are comparatively rare - extremely rare.
In fact, within the Milky Way scientists\h\h

1335
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:50,600
estimate that they make up no more than\h
a quadrillionth the amount of matter.\h

1336
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:55,640
And so this raises the question,\h
where are all the positrons?

1337
01:50:55,640 --> 01:51:01,440
You might wonder why this is important, but\h
it is really another question of symmetry.\h

1338
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:07,440
Imagine the processes underway in the very early\h
universe, at the time when matter was created.\h

1339
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:13,760
If the processes were purely symmetric, they would\h
have made equal amounts of matter and antimatter.\h

1340
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:19,360
For every electron that was created, a\h
corresponding positron would be created.

1341
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:23,440
After the fiery birth of the Big\h
Bang, these equal quantities of\h\h

1342
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:28,240
matter and antimatter would annihilate,
And this complete annihilation that would\h\h

1343
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:33,560
leave nothing behind but a\h
featureless soup of radiation.\h

1344
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:39,200
With no matter, there would be no\h
atoms, no stars, no planets, no people.\h

1345
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:43,920
The universe would simply settle\h
down into a featureless nothing.

1346
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:48,120
So, there must have been a break\h
in the physics of matter creation,\h

1347
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:54,680
A tiny asymmetry of one part in a billion that\h
left one electron for every billion annihilations,\h

1348
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:59,880
As well as protons rather than antiprotons,\h
neutrons rather than antineutrons,\h

1349
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:04,160
Leaving behind the matter from which we are made.

1350
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:08,720
Physicists are not quite sure where\h
this crack is hidden in their theories,\h

1351
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:13,440
And perhaps they will need their theory of\h
everything for this to finally be revealed,\h

1352
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:16,320
But other cracks in symmetry are apparent,\h

1353
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:22,520
And these might be providing clues to\h
the ultimate nature of these asymmetries.

1354
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:34,440
The culprit is the weak force, the\h
strangest member of the fundamental forces.\h

1355
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:40,440
Unlike the other forces, the weak force seems\h
to distinguish between matter and antimatter.

1356
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:45,200
To understand this, let’s start by\h
thinking about a single hydrogen atom.\h

1357
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:50,480
This simplest of elements comprises of a\h
positively charged proton at its nucleus,\h

1358
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:53,800
Which is orbited by a negatively charged electron.\h

1359
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:59,880
When this electron jumps in its orbits, it\h
absorbs or emits a particular pattern of light.

1360
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:03,640
What would happen if we considered\h
instead an atom of anti-hydrogen,\h

1361
01:53:03,640 --> 01:53:10,120
This would be a negatively charged anti-proton\h
orbited by a positively charged positron.\h

1362
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:15,240
When the positron jumps in its orbit, again\h
a pattern of light is absorbed or emitted,\h

1363
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:19,520
And this pattern is precisely what\h
is seen for everyday hydrogen.

1364
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:25,040
This shows that electromagnetism is symmetric\h
when considering matter and anti-matter,\h

1365
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:28,600
And the same is true of the\h
strong force and even gravity.\h

1366
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:33,000
But not the weak force. The\h
weak force is not symmetrical,\h

1367
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,200
The outcome of reactions is different depending\h\h

1368
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:40,680
on whether they take place\h
with matter or anti-matter.

1369
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:47,280
This is strangely tied to one of the universe’s\h
most mysterious particles, the neutrino.\h

1370
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:52,440
The neutrino only interacts via the weak force,\h
so it’s always a player in weak interaction.\h

1371
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:57,840
What makes the neutrino bizarre has something\h
to do with one of its fundamental properties,\h

1372
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:02,240
And that is that all neutrinos spin the same way.

1373
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:08,440
This is a quantum property and quantum spin comes\h
in quantized amounts - they do not literally spin.

1374
01:54:08,440 --> 01:54:13,200
Photons of light also possess spin,\h
one unit of it in quantized amounts,\h

1375
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:18,520
And you can think of spin being right\h
or left-handed as the photon travels.\h

1376
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:22,360
In our universe, we see both\h
left-handed and right-handed photons,\h

1377
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:26,120
But the same is not true for neutrinos.

1378
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:28,640
All neutrinos are left-handed,\h\h

1379
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:32,760
whilst their anti-matter cousins,\h
anti-neutrinos, are right-handed,\h

1380
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:38,040
And this differentiates the interactions\h
between matter and anti-matter.\h

1381
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:41,320
But why do the neutrino and\h
the weak force differentiate\h\h

1382
01:54:41,320 --> 01:54:46,800
between left and right in the universe?
Physicists still don’t know the answer,\h\h

1383
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:52,560
but this crack in reality appears to have been\h
essential for our very existence - without it\h\h

1384
01:54:52,560 --> 01:55:01,480
everything would have been completely\h
annhialated in the opening seconds of the cosmos.

1385
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:05,320
We have come a long way in this\h
description of the rules of reality,\h

1386
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:11,720
We’ve discussed quantum fields and broken\h
symmetries, warped spaces and cracked symmetries,

1387
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:18,000
But there is one final example that shows how\h
truly bizarre the quantum world really is,\h\h

1388
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:22,320
when you follow its rules to the very end.

1389
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:26,240
Look up at the night sky.

1390
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:31,200
The light you see from distant stars is\h
detected through electrons in your eyes\h\h

1391
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:36,800
exchanging photons with electrons\h
from millions of light years away.

1392
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:40,640
For two electrons to experience\h
the electromagnetic force,\h\h

1393
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:46,960
they excite a vibration in the photon field.
This photon travels between the two electrons,\h\h

1394
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:50,280
communicating the force.
But how do the electrons\h\h

1395
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:56,080
decide that they will exchange a photon\h
and experience the electromagnetic force?\h

1396
01:55:56,080 --> 01:56:02,320
You might think that one electron generates the\h
photon vibration which randomly impacts the other.

1397
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:07,160
However, this is not how\h
quantum mathematics works.\h

1398
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:15,480
For the photon to be exchanged, the electrons\h
have to agree – one to emit, one to receive.\h

1399
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:17,680
But how can they agree as\h
they can only communicate\h\h

1400
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:21,320
at the speed of light, through photons?

1401
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:22,541
So, what do the mathematics actually say?

1402
01:56:22,541 --> 01:56:25,520
Well, It all becomes a matter of interpretation.\h

1403
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:30,760
In what is known as the transactional\h
interpretation the electrons communicate,\h

1404
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:35,120
A handshake between the electrons\h
that is part of the photon exchange,\h

1405
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:41,400
But to achieve this, the electrons\h
exchange these handshakes through time!

1406
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:46,480
One electron sends its handshake into\h
the future, the other into the past,\h

1407
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:49,560
And with a mutual agreement,\h
the photon is exchanged,\h

1408
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:59,200
even across billions of light\h
years, and one day even trillions.\h

1409
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:04,840
But this need for time travel as a fundamental\h
piece of reality is too much for some,\h

1410
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:12,520
who dismiss it as a mathematical convenience\h
that masks something more fundamental.

1411
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:17,640
And so where does this actually\h
leave us in understanding reality?\h

1412
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:21,920
From holographic universes to\h
wild mathematical implications,\h\h

1413
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:28,520
we now find ourselves at the philosophical\h
edge of science and what science even is.\h

1414
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:33,400
Is it a search for the truth, to\h
uncover the ultimate nature of reality?\h

1415
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:39,400
Or is the best it can ever do is give us a\h
mathematical approximation, a representation,\h

1416
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:43,490
Of a true reality that is forever hidden.

1417
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:48,400
Your thoughts race as your mind tries\h
to process this complicated picture.

1418
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:51,160
But suddenly, the confusion is pushed aside,\h

1419
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:55,280
As another thought snaps\h
front and centre in your mind.

1420
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:59,540
If nothing is real, then just what are you?

1421
01:57:59,540 --> 01:58:03,960
Just where do your thoughts reside?

1422
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:15,160
Where are you?
________________\h

1423
01:58:15,160 --> 01:58:19,200
There is an ancient Greek legend\h
about the ship of Theseus.\h

1424
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:23,440
Over the centuries, time and travel\h
takes its toll on the aging vessel,\h

1425
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:27,520
And constant maintenance and repair\h
are needed to keep it afloat.

1426
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:30,080
Eventually, every plank and every nail,\h\h

1427
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:33,920
every stick of thread and yard\h
of sail, has been replaced.\h

1428
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:39,160
Eventually, no original piece\h
of the ship of Theseus remains.

1429
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:44,000
The philosophers of Ancient Greece pondered\h
whether this is still the ship of Theseus,\h

1430
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:50,720
And if it wasn’t, when did Theseus’s ship stop\h
being Theseus’s ship and become something else?

1431
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:56,040
It might seem that discussions about an legendary\h
ship are little more than philosophical musings,\h

1432
01:58:56,040 --> 01:59:00,080
But the ancient idea has\h
some profound implications,\h

1433
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:05,199
Implications about the reality of you.

1434
01:59:05,199 --> 01:59:06,760
Let’s start with a simple question\h
– how old are you - really?

1435
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:07,880
If you cut yourself,\h\h

1436
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:11,112
vividly red blood will flow from the wound.
The colour comes from red blood cells,\h\h

1437
01:59:11,112 --> 01:59:12,920
tiny cells suspended in a straw-coloured plasma.
But is the blood that flows in your\h\h

1438
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:20,320
veins the same as when you were a child?
Just how long does a red blood cell survive?

1439
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:23,160
Made deep in the dark marrow of our bones,\h

1440
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:28,840
A red blood cell lives a mere four months before\h
it is broken down and excreted from the body.\h

1441
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:32,880
Every second, about five million red\h
blood cells meet their ultimate demise,\h

1442
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:36,320
As freshly made cells flow into\h
your bloodstream to replace them.\h

1443
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:39,640
Your body completely replaces\h
your blood three times a year.

1444
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:43,200
Indeed, almost all of your body is\h
eventually broken down and replaced.\h

1445
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:45,520
Your skin is replaced every few weeks,\h

1446
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:50,720
and for your internal organs, it might take a\h
decade, but they too are eventually replaced.\h

1447
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:54,760
Whereas your bones regenerate\h
over about fifteen years.

1448
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:58,415
You are literally not the person you used to be.

1449
01:59:58,415 --> 01:59:58,505
Some mission-critical cells, such are nerves\h
or in your heart, are effectively permanent,\h

1450
01:59:58,505 --> 01:59:58,553
But the rest come and go over your entire life.

1451
01:59:58,553 --> 02:00:01,440
And this is true of you and everyone you know,
Every one of us, and all living creatures,\h\h

1452
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:03,069
are biological ships of Theseus.

1453
02:00:03,069 --> 02:00:09,504
This can be hard to come to terms with.
You can see the scars you gained in childhood.\h

1454
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:17,600
And so - are you still the same you that was born?
Are you the same you, even though your individual\h\h

1455
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:22,560
cells have been replaced over and over?
And like the ship of Theseus, if you are not\h\h

1456
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:31,240
the original you, when did this transition occur?
And if you are not you, then just what are you?

1457
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:35,840
What makes you, you?

1458
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:40,960
The location of the mind, the seat of\h
consciousness, has long been mysterious.

1459
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:45,000
To the Ancient Egyptians, the heart\h
was the centre of all activity.\h

1460
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:50,600
It was home to the soul, with thoughts\h
radiating out to the bodily extremities.\h

1461
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:50,762
This view was adopted by the\h
great philosopher Aristotle,\h

1462
02:00:50,762 --> 02:00:50,835
Claiming the brain was too far from\h
the centre of things to be important.

1463
02:00:50,835 --> 02:00:55,880
This confusion was born out of a\h
problem of thinking about thinking.\h

1464
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:58,663
Just what is a thought?
Clearly dissecting a corpse\h\h

1465
02:00:58,663 --> 02:00:59,380
will reveal nothing physical, as\h
consciousness will have departed,\h

1466
02:00:59,450 --> 02:01:02,840
In the 17th century Descartes decided that the\h
brain and the mind must be separate things,\h

1467
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:09,280
And Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\h
supported Descartes's view on\h\h

1468
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:11,400
the separation of brain and mind,\h

1469
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:15,760
asking you to imagine him shrunk\h
smaller than the size of a flea.

1470
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:20,760
At this minute size, he then invited\h
you to join him on a tour of the brain,\h

1471
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:25,520
As you wander around, there would be no\h
sight of thoughts within the fleshy material,\h

1472
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:30,080
No ideas bubbling away inside\h
all of the biological machinery.\h

1473
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:36,200
No, he said, the mind is something separate,\h
something distinct, from the brain.

1474
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:40,800
But with the coming of the twentieth century,\h
Descartes's dualism came under attack,\h

1475
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:46,600
for advances in technology and biological\h
understanding began to look at the working brain.\h

1476
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:52,320
Real-time mapping revealed that Leibniz’s\h
fanciful journey might be blind to seeing thoughts\h

1477
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:54,280
Not due to anything mystical,\h

1478
02:01:54,280 --> 02:02:00,200
But because thoughts, whilst apparently\h
physical, are invisible to the naked eye.

1479
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:07,960
The secret to the mind was electricity.

1480
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:13,840
With sensitive mapping, it was discovered that the\h
brain pulses and bursts with electrical activity,\h

1481
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:17,840
With certain sensations and feelings\h
lighting up different parts of it.

1482
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:21,600
It was realised that the brain\h
is a highly convoluted network,\h

1483
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:25,640
More than eighty billion neurons\h
with a myriad of interconnections,\h

1484
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:29,280
Signals trigger new signals that\h
flow throughout the network,\h

1485
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:34,880
Electrical activity surges and\h
cycles - builds up and dies away.

1486
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:39,640
But though it might be satisfying to think\h
that the mind is messy electrical signals,\h

1487
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:43,640
Many mysteries still remain\h
as to just how it works.

1488
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:45,200
Where is thought? Where is\h\h

1489
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:48,472
love? Where is creativity and imagination?
Where are memories stored? Why can I remember\h\h

1490
02:02:48,472 --> 02:02:51,080
the lyrics of songs I haven’t heard in years?
Just how the brain works is a puzzle,\h\h

1491
02:02:51,080 --> 02:02:54,480
a clouded enigma,
Indeed - even the great brain of\h\h

1492
02:02:54,480 --> 02:03:04,200
Einstein was remarkable for being unremarkable,\h
stolen from its skull in his autopsy.

1493
02:03:04,200 --> 02:03:09,600
But focus has since grown on the complexity\h
of the neural network inside our heads.\h

1494
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:13,480
Maybe consciousness and thought\h
are a result of this complexity,\h

1495
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:19,320
An emergent phenomenon that can’t simply\h
be revealed by exploring the network.

1496
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:21,760
More than the sum of its parts.

1497
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:27,200
Emergent phenomena have often\h
confused and bemused scientists.\h

1498
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:30,360
Indeed, emergent phenomena\h
have often mystified many.

1499
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:34,760
There is a famous story of a soviet aide\h
visiting London in the nineteen eighties,\h

1500
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:38,880
Wanting to seek out the person who\h
organises the bread production in the city.

1501
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:43,920
In the Soviet system, bread production was\h
centralized, with every step controlled.\h

1502
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:49,720
But in cities like Moscow, long queues at bread\h
shops formed due to inefficiencies in the system.\h

1503
02:03:49,720 --> 02:03:53,120
In the West, there was no\h
bread Czar managing production,\h

1504
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:59,760
Yet an effective system had emerged from\h
many, many workers performing their own tasks.

1505
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:02,520
It was reminiscent of an ants’ nest.\h

1506
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:08,600
If you watch such a nest, many thousands of\h
ants scurry about, seemingly with purpose.\h

1507
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:12,280
But no one ant controls the\h
behaviour of the colony.\h

1508
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:19,360
Instead, complex emergent phenomena arise\h
from each ant following a simple set of rules.

1509
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:23,280
Emergent phenomena can be found\h
across the physical world.\h

1510
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:28,360
Water is nothing but a collection of molecules\h
attracting and repelling through electromagnetism,\h

1511
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:33,880
But a body of water can flow and bubble,\h
with turbulent eddies and swirls,\h

1512
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:37,600
Emergent behaviour from simple rules.

1513
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:42,160
The physical properties of matter and\h
gases also emerge from simple rules,\h

1514
02:04:42,160 --> 02:04:47,720
And some now wonder if these simple rules\h
emerge from even more fundamental phenomena.\h

1515
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:52,400
Perhaps gravity emerges from truly\h
fundamental pieces of space and time,\h

1516
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:58,360
In the same way that the properties of water\h
emerge from the interactions of molecules.

1517
02:04:58,360 --> 02:05:02,320
And so could it be true that\h
the reality that you experience,\h\h

1518
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:08,600
the world of wonders inside your head, is\h
just the result of some complex wiring?

1519
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:14,600
Some find this conclusion unsettling.
But for others, this notion gives them great hope.

1520
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:20,600
If consciousness is just the result of complexity,\h
not something beyond the physical domain,\h

1521
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:26,120
Then maybe we have the hope of recreating,\h
if not exceeding, consciousness.\h

1522
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:29,840
This has been the goal of artificial\h
intelligence for many decades,\h

1523
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:32,000
To build ever more complex networks,\h\h

1524
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:39,120
both virtual and physical, in the\h
hope that intelligence emerges.

1525
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:45,520
There is a branch of physics, known as synthetic\h
intelligence, that plans to put this to the test.\h

1526
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:50,480
This is unlike artificial intelligence, where\h
people are trying to make computers think.\h

1527
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:56,840
Instead, in synthetic intelligence, physicists\h
are building complex nano-wire networks,\h

1528
02:05:56,840 --> 02:06:01,600
Wires that act like the neurons\h
and connections in our own minds.

1529
02:06:01,600 --> 02:06:06,920
They hope that electric currents pulsing through\h
these wires would represent electronic thoughts,\h

1530
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:13,520
And these nano-wires, that have the ability to\h
reorganise, will have the ability to remember,\h

1531
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:16,200
This, of course, sounds like science fiction,\h

1532
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:21,560
But we might only be a few steps\h
from the dream of thinking machines.

1533
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:27,440
Of course, for those who cling to Descartes’s\h
dualism, this is nothing but an empty quest,\h

1534
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:31,960
As no physical mechanism will ever\h
think in the way that humans do,\h

1535
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:36,280
But for the believers, it is all just\h
a question of time and complexity,\h

1536
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:41,800
And one day their networks will\h
become aware, become alive.

1537
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:47,680
But if consciousness is purely physical, then\h
deeper philosophical questions begin to emerge.\h

1538
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:53,560
Are physical processes really playing\h
out in fleshy pulp inside your skull?\h

1539
02:06:53,560 --> 02:06:58,920
What if you are a brain in a vat, being\h
fed stimulation from a virtual reality?\h

1540
02:06:58,920 --> 02:07:04,120
What if you are not a physical brain at all,\h
but just software executing on a computer?

1541
02:07:04,120 --> 02:07:06,880
And what if Descartes's dualism is right,\h\h

1542
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:11,040
and that consciousness truly\h
exists beyond the physical world?\h

1543
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:21,520
A more ethereal plane where\h
something like a soul resides.

1544
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:25,440
This opens another philosophical question,\h\h

1545
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:29,480
one that might be more challenging\h
for the idea of reality.\h

1546
02:07:29,480 --> 02:07:34,240
Why should consciousness and thought\h
be constrained to being human?\h

1547
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:41,400
What if it was much more widespread than that?
What if consciousness is everywhere?

1548
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:44,960
It sounds again like we have entered\h
the realm of science fiction,\h

1549
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:49,120
But this notion of a ubiquitous\h
consciousness, of panpsychism,\h\h

1550
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:54,000
has been discussed by prominent philosophers,
A consciousness that inhabits all corners\h\h

1551
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,560
of the universe,
That everything,\h\h

1552
02:07:56,560 --> 02:08:00,840
every particle, is, in some sense, alive.

1553
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:07,780
People, trees, rocks, sand, dust, stars, galaxies,\h
black holes, and plants – Everything conscious.\h

1554
02:08:07,780 --> 02:08:20,000
Even molecules, atoms, protons, quarks,\h
and electrons - even the universe.

1555
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:25,760
This idea, whilst beloved by some philosophers,\h
is too much for physicists to stomach.\h

1556
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:29,920
Philosophers tell them that it somehow links\h
with the weirdness of quantum mechanics,\h

1557
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:35,720
But physicists simply feel that this is well\h
beyond the bounds of what they class as science,\h

1558
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:41,320
And, as ever, both groups\h
tend to ignore each other.

1559
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:47,040
Could everything be conscious? Is reality alive?\h

1560
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:53,120
Your scientific mind ponders on this for a\h
moment, but concludes it is a step too far.,\h

1561
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:58,000
And so you turn your head and look\h
over, once again, at the apple.

1562
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:01,680
It fills your focus, as your\h
brain processes all the aspects\h\h

1563
02:09:01,680 --> 02:09:06,800
of reality that have crossed your mind,
You wonder about the apple from its entirety\h\h

1564
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:09,880
to its fundamental pieces,
And as you think about\h\h

1565
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:16,960
its existence and its reality,
You wonder if the apple is contemplating yours!

1566
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:21,360
You start to wonder if your thoughts\h
on reality could get any weirder.

1567
02:09:22,760 --> 02:09:37,080
Of course they can.
________________\h

1568
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:41,360
Picture a scientist - What\h
picture pops into your mind?\h

1569
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:44,160
For many, it will be the\h
wiry-haired Albert Einstein,\h\h

1570
02:09:44,160 --> 02:09:48,320
late in life with a wrinkled face.
Perhaps with his tongue sticking out.\h

1571
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:53,240
Or maybe Isaac Newton in his formal\h
regalia and eighteenth-century wig.

1572
02:09:53,240 --> 02:09:58,920
But these images are of these great scientists\h
many years after their seminal works.

1573
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:04,480
The alleged comedy show, The Big Bang Theory, has\h
shown us that science is a young person’s game.\h

1574
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:09,040
and although the awkwardness that is played for\h
laughs is an unhelpful scientific stereotype,\h

1575
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:13,600
it is correct that most scientists make\h
their biggest breakthroughs when young.\h

1576
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:18,960
Indeed, it is important to remember that Einstein\h
was only twenty-six during his miraculous year.

1577
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:23,840
Isaac Newton was also a young man when\h
he had his greatest insights into nature.\h

1578
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:28,640
And in sixteen sixty-six he was\h
just twenty-three years old.\h

1579
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:33,440
He had already proved himself as precocious, and\h
had been studying at the University of Cambridge,\h

1580
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:37,720
But this year was to be a year like no other.

1581
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:42,600
The black death had returned again to Britain.
The bubonic plague first raged across Europe\h\h

1582
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:46,400
in the fourteenth century, but\h
it had never really gone away.\h

1583
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:51,000
For centuries it resurged and cut a\h
swath through European populations.

1584
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:57,280
With its arrival in 1666, people had fled the\h
cities for the relative safety of the countryside.\h

1585
02:10:57,280 --> 02:11:00,920
And Isaac Newton left Cambridge for\h
his family farm in the village of\h\h

1586
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:04,960
Woolsthorpe in Lincolnshire.
As death stalked the land,\h\h

1587
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:08,160
Newton found solace under his famous apple tree,\h

1588
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:17,480
And his mind turned to unravelling\h
the secrets of the universe.

1589
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:22,280
We have already met Newton’s ideas of space\h
and time, but let’s look again at time.\h

1590
02:11:24,600 --> 02:11:29,480
With his equations of motion, Newton could\h
calculate how things changed with time,\h

1591
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:33,200
And time could be neatly cleaved\h
into three distinct pieces,\h

1592
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:39,360
A past that had gone, a future that is\h
yet to come, and an instant that is now.

1593
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:46,400
Reality, it appeared, existed at this unique\h
instant of now, a precise and exact now,\h

1594
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:49,640
Evolving from its state in the\h
past to the present - and we\h\h

1595
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:53,160
can calculate what will happen on into the future.\h

1596
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:59,080
But Newton’s equations are purely deterministic,\h
and if we had perfect knowledge at any time,\h

1597
02:11:59,080 --> 02:12:04,760
We could calculate the exact state\h
of the universe at any other instant.

1598
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:11,600
This raises an interesting question – in a\h
Newtonian universe, has the past really gone?\h

1599
02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:17,400
Is the future really unknown and yet to come?
In some sense, the realities of the past,\h\h

1600
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:21,880
present and future all exist,
And the instance of now is just\h\h

1601
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:30,280
sliding through this already complete history,\h
with us just experiencing a moment of reality.

1602
02:12:30,280 --> 02:12:34,600
This idea returned with a vengeance\h
in Einstein’s theory of relativity,\h

1603
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:38,920
Instead of just a background, space\h
and time became central to the story,\h

1604
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:44,240
With each fundamental particle tracing\h
out a distinct path, its worldline,\h\h

1605
02:12:44,240 --> 02:12:47,680
through these four dimensions.
And like Newton, Einstein’s\h\h

1606
02:12:47,680 --> 02:12:54,200
universe is purely deterministic, with\h
past, present and future all existing.

1607
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:57,400
This came to be known as the Block Universe.

1608
02:12:57,400 --> 02:13:03,040
And once again, the mathematics is\h
pretty clear on something quite bizarre.

1609
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:09,520
The equations of relativity are unequivocal\h
– Einstein’s universe is a block universe.\h

1610
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:15,320
With perfect knowledge, there is no mystery about\h
the future as it can be calculated from now.\h

1611
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:22,840
In fact, Einstein’s equations don’t define just\h
when now is – you have to define when now is.\h

1612
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:31,920
There is nothing special about\h
now in Einstein’s universe.

1613
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:35,720
Of course, the block universe\h
raises some uncomfortable questions,\h\h

1614
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:39,680
questions around free will.
The ability to choose between\h\h

1615
02:13:39,680 --> 02:13:42,240
possible options seems innately human,\h

1616
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:47,617
But in the block universe, this is just an\h
illusion as the future is already written,\h

1617
02:13:47,800 --> 02:13:54,560
The block universe also has bigger consequences,\h
consequences that stray back into science fiction.\h

1618
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:59,680
If the past and future are out there in the\h
block universe, could we ever reach them?\h

1619
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:04,640
Out there is DaVinci and dinosaurs, and\h
everything, every creature, that will ever be.\h

1620
02:14:04,640 --> 02:14:13,280
And maybe there are convoluted spacetime paths\h
that will mean we will experience them in our now.

1621
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:15,480
But the issue is that the block universe\h\h

1622
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:20,680
just doesn’t feel real – surely the\h
future is unknown and yet to come.\h

1623
02:14:20,680 --> 02:14:26,080
And so many tried to look beyond the raw\h
theories of Einstein to provide the answer.

1624
02:14:26,080 --> 02:14:28,400
Eventually, the probabilistic nature of quantum\h\h

1625
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:32,480
mechanics appeared to show that\h
Einstein could not be correct,\h

1626
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:37,160
the future being written from the\h
possible outcomes of quantum questions.

1627
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:40,320
And so the picture that emerges\h
from this compromise is that the\h\h

1628
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:48,880
universe is a block universe up to a point.
And that point is now – now is constantly being\h\h

1629
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:54,840
constructed as quantum questions are answered.
Now adds another sheet of reality to the\h\h

1630
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:58,680
block universe, unfolding an\h
unknown future in front of us,\h

1631
02:14:58,680 --> 02:15:03,760
With the past solidified into the block behind us.

1632
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:08,000
And interestingly, this is the picture\h
offered by loop quantum gravity.

1633
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:11,320
One of the contenders for a\h
quantum theory of gravity,\h

1634
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:16,720
Within this theory, space and time are\h
constantly being weaved from fundamental loops,\h

1635
02:15:16,720 --> 02:15:23,400
Now is the edge of the weave, the past is the\h
tapestry, and the future is the unknown ahead.

1636
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:30,840
Our reality, our now, would be at the busy\h
edge of the construction of space and time.

1637
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:35,280
This gives you pause for thought.
Is the apple you see now the same\h\h

1638
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:40,080
apple you saw just a moment ago?
Is its time, space and fundamental\h\h

1639
02:15:40,080 --> 02:15:44,160
constituents constantly being knitted\h
from the ultimate fundamental?\h

1640
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:49,460
Are you and the apple being rewritten\h
at every single instant you experience?

1641
02:15:49,460 --> 02:15:57,720
After deconstruction after deconstruction, your\h
grip on reality seems to be definitely slipping.

1642
02:15:57,720 --> 02:16:03,280
You settle on a simpler question\h
- Where does reality exist?

1643
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:05,480
Maybe reality is just the block universe,\h\h

1644
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:08,880
and that’s all there is. Maybe\h
free will is an illusion?\h

1645
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:12,640
Or maybe loop quantum gravity is\h
correct, and reality exists as an\h\h

1646
02:16:12,640 --> 02:16:17,280
instant of an unfolding universe.
But what if there is something\h\h

1647
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:22,960
much deeper underlying reality,\h
something that is not physical?\h

1648
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:33,520
What if at the bottom, reality\h
is nothing by just numbers?

1649
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:36,240
The notion isn’t as strange as you might expect,\h

1650
02:16:36,240 --> 02:16:42,359
Indeed, it reflects our understanding of\h
the workings of the fundamental universe.

1651
02:16:42,359 --> 02:16:46,280
Written at the heart of all physical\h
laws is the notion of information,\h\h

1652
02:16:46,280 --> 02:16:50,840
and information processing.
Just what do the laws of physics do?\h

1653
02:16:51,479 --> 02:16:55,759
They take what we know about a particular\h
situation, the information of that situation,\h

1654
02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:59,520
Such as the location and velocity\h
of a ball flying through the air,\h

1655
02:16:59,520 --> 02:17:04,520
And process it into information\h
of that scenario into the future.

1656
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:07,960
This is probably most apparent in\h
the rules of quantum mechanics,\h

1657
02:17:07,960 --> 02:17:12,680
Where the information of a scenario\h
is encoded into the wavefunction.\h

1658
02:17:12,680 --> 02:17:18,760
The rules of the quantum evolve the\h
wavefunction, the information, into the future,\h

1659
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:23,840
Numbers are churned into new numbers\h
as the laws of physics are played out.

1660
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:28,240
This all might sound a little esoteric,
But by the mid-twentieth century,\h\h

1661
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:32,519
strong links had emerged between\h
information and thermodynamics,\h

1662
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:37,439
as it was realised that the effort\h
to process a signal requires energy.\h

1663
02:17:37,439 --> 02:17:42,439
A computer has to expend energy to flip\h
a bit from a one to a zero or vice versa,\h

1664
02:17:42,439 --> 02:17:46,759
As does your brain as you process\h
even the simplest of thoughts.

1665
02:17:46,760 --> 02:17:52,560
All of this has led some to propose that\h
everything is really information processing,\h

1666
02:17:52,560 --> 02:17:57,520
That there is no fundamental difference between\h
the processing of information on a computer,\h

1667
02:17:57,520 --> 02:18:00,479
Or the processing of information in your mind,\h

1668
02:18:00,479 --> 02:18:05,020
Or the processing of physical\h
information that underpins reality.

1669
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:10,800
And this is the foundation of what is\h
known as the simulation hypothesis.\h

1670
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:17,760
This states that our thoughts, memories, and all\h
of our experiences are nothing but computations.\h

1671
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:21,720
This is deeper than the idea of a brain\h
in a vat that we encountered previously,\h

1672
02:18:21,720 --> 02:18:32,200
As there is no physical brain. In fact, in our\h
reality, there would be nothing physical at all.

1673
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:36,160
Of course, the simulation hypothesis\h
raises an immediate question – just\h\h

1674
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:41,439
where are these computations taking place?
Perhaps these exist in a higher reality,\h\h

1675
02:18:41,439 --> 02:18:44,519
a physical domain that we can know nothing about.\h

1676
02:18:44,520 --> 02:18:50,439
But what are the goals of our simulated\h
reality? Why did our creators create us?\h

1677
02:18:50,439 --> 02:18:56,120
What if we are little more than\h
characters in a game of Sims?

1678
02:18:56,120 --> 02:19:00,439
Indeed, what if the simulation\h
was not created for us?\h

1679
02:19:00,439 --> 02:19:04,839
What if it was constructed to explore\h
other aspects of synthetic universes,\h

1680
02:19:04,840 --> 02:19:07,960
And we are nothing but an unexpected side effect.\h

1681
02:19:07,960 --> 02:19:17,319
What if the creators know nothing about\h
our existence, and care even less?

1682
02:19:17,319 --> 02:19:22,319
Of course, we can argue about all these\h
questions for the answers might always elude us,\h

1683
02:19:22,319 --> 02:19:26,200
But here on Earth, physicists\h
do generate synthetic universes\h\h

1684
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:28,840
with the goal of understanding our reality,\h

1685
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:34,680
And also explore other seemingly hypothetical\h
universes where the laws of physics are different.\h

1686
02:19:34,680 --> 02:19:40,391
Maybe one day, with powerful computers, conscious\h
creations may inhabit our synthetic universes.

1687
02:19:40,391 --> 02:19:42,200
At this point, an important question\h
might have crossed your mind.\h

1688
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:47,760
Even if we are living in a simulated universe\h
so that our reality is completely synthetic,\h

1689
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:53,760
Surely our creators inhabit a\h
real reality, a physical reality.\h

1690
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:59,720
Have we just pushed the problem upwards,\h
or is it turtles all the way down?

1691
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:04,600
We come to this conclusion because we imagine\h
that there must be a physical computer,\h

1692
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:11,120
A device that carries out the calculations that\h
construct our reality and synthesize our universe.\h

1693
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:16,160
But what if there is not? What\h
if there is no physical basis for\h\h

1694
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:26,399
reality? What if there are only calculations?
This is the idea of the mathematical universe.

1695
02:20:26,399 --> 02:20:31,000
The lead proponent of the mathematical\h
universe is Swedish-born Max Tegmark.\h

1696
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:34,960
In his earlier research he focused on\h
the challenges of modern cosmology.\h

1697
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:39,720
But eventually he turned his attention\h
to some of the biggest questions we have.

1698
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:44,800
His mathematical universe is similar to\h
that of a simulation hypothesis universe,\h

1699
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:48,880
But without the need for a physical\h
computer to do the computations.\h

1700
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:51,840
But where would these calculations be performed.\h

1701
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:56,680
What would be performing them? Surely\h
you need a computer to compute.

1702
02:20:56,680 --> 02:21:02,439
But being truly fundamental means\h
that these mathematics just exist,\h

1703
02:21:02,439 --> 02:21:08,519
And there would be no real answer to\h
where they came from or where they exist.

1704
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:13,240
Intriguingly, Tegmark’s mathematical\h
universe actually a multiverse,\h

1705
02:21:13,240 --> 02:21:17,359
Containing not only our universe\h
but all possible universes.\h

1706
02:21:17,359 --> 02:21:20,319
In the growing maelstrom of\h
mathematical calculations,\h\h

1707
02:21:20,319 --> 02:21:23,240
there is not only our particular reality,\h

1708
02:21:23,240 --> 02:21:29,439
But all possible realities, each defined but\h
distinct mathematical structures of their own.

1709
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:33,160
Across this multiverse, there should\h
be mathematics very similar to our own,\h

1710
02:21:33,160 --> 02:21:37,840
With multiple versions of you,\h
whatever you really are, out there.\h

1711
02:21:37,840 --> 02:21:40,880
There will be other universes which\h
are quite different to our own,\h

1712
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:43,760
Different in terms of the strengths\h
of the fundamental forces,\h\h

1713
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:46,560
or dimensions of space and time.

1714
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:50,520
The library of possible mathematics\h
is immense, possibly infinite,\h

1715
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:53,359
But it is definitely much larger than the subset\h\h

1716
02:21:53,359 --> 02:21:57,319
of mathematical structures we\h
use to describe our cosmos.\h

1717
02:21:57,319 --> 02:22:03,280
So out there in the sea of fundamental\h
mathematics, there could be much, much more,\h

1718
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:13,080
Not only universes we have not dreamed\h
of, but many we could never dream of.

1719
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:16,720
And one last horror, one prospect of reality,\h\h

1720
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:24,240
exists in the mathematical universe.
And it is tied to infinity.

1721
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:28,160
Every so often within the\h
infinite sea of calculations,\h\h

1722
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:32,240
the right calculations will\h
randomly come together.\h

1723
02:22:32,240 --> 02:22:39,519
These calculations will look just like your mind,\h
a mind filled with your memories and reality.\h

1724
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:45,161
In an instant, you will be created,\h
maybe considering an apple.

1725
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:50,520
To this brand-new mind, with all of its\h
memories, everything seems completely normal.\h

1726
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:55,680
They remember the big events of their lives\h
and picking their apple from the tree.

1727
02:22:55,680 --> 02:23:01,680
But the existence of this mind is only\h
temporary, only a mathematical fluctuation.\h

1728
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:06,359
As quickly as the mathematical structure\h
of this mind came into being, it vanishes\h\h

1729
02:23:06,359 --> 02:23:09,639
back into the wash.
This consciousness,\h\h

1730
02:23:09,640 --> 02:23:17,240
with experiences of reality as real as\h
ours, is doomed to disappear in an instant.

1731
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:20,760
Indeed, these relatively tiny\h
fluctuations in the mathematics\h\h

1732
02:23:20,760 --> 02:23:25,920
would massively outweigh the\h
likelihood of our entire cosmos.

1733
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:32,359
How do you know that you are not one of\h
these minds that will vanish in a moment?\h

1734
02:23:32,359 --> 02:23:36,960
How do you know that anything you\h
think is real was there a moment ago?\h

1735
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:42,120
How do you know that you are not\h
about to wink out of existence?

1736
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:46,640
By now you might be thinking,\h
well, this is ridiculous.\h

1737
02:23:46,640 --> 02:23:50,440
I know that I am not a mathematical structure,\h
and I remember what has happened to me.\h

1738
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,720
There is no chance that I\h
am a temporary existence,\h

1739
02:23:53,720 --> 02:23:57,319
I know that I am truly real.

1740
02:23:57,319 --> 02:24:08,799
But unfortunately getting rid of the\h
mathematical universe does not fix this problem.

1741
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:12,720
It is believed our cosmos has an\h
infinite amount of time ahead of us.\h

1742
02:24:12,720 --> 02:24:16,680
And for this infinity, the universe\h
is going to be cold and empty,\h

1743
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:23,399
Long after the last star has died and the final\h
black hole has evaporated into the background.

1744
02:24:23,399 --> 02:24:27,920
And so it might seem that we would reach\h
the end of the story of the universe,\h

1745
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:31,920
As not a lot will happen in our\h
future empty cosmos – surely it\h\h

1746
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:36,880
will be a quiet, uneventful place.
But the future universe might not\h\h

1747
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:41,960
be as dead and buried as it might seem,
And to understand this, we need to explore\h\h

1748
02:24:41,960 --> 02:24:50,439
one of the most misunderstood\h
concepts in physics – entropy.

1749
02:24:50,439 --> 02:24:55,319
Ludwig Boltzmann was one of the most\h
insightful minds of nineteenth-century science.\h

1750
02:24:55,319 --> 02:24:59,559
Before it was widely accepted, he was\h
a supporter of the atomic hypothesis,\h

1751
02:24:59,560 --> 02:25:03,600
The notion that at the smallest level,\h
matter is made of indivisible atoms,\h

1752
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:07,240
And he recast the laws of\h
energy flow, thermodynamics,\h\h

1753
02:25:07,240 --> 02:25:10,880
in terms of the motion of these invisible atoms.

1754
02:25:10,880 --> 02:25:14,840
Boltzmann’s view attracted criticism\h
from the scientific greats of his time,\h

1755
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:20,319
But shortly before his death in nineteen o’six,\h
direct evidence for atoms began to appear.\h

1756
02:25:20,840 --> 02:25:25,960
In pondering the realm of atoms, Boltzmann\h
wondered about how they could be arranged.\h

1757
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:29,960
Think about the air around you,\h
atoms of nitrogen, oxygen and\h\h

1758
02:25:29,960 --> 02:25:35,399
carbon bound into a myriad of molecules.
These molecules are whizzing about, colliding\h\h

1759
02:25:35,399 --> 02:25:40,080
with each other, with the walls and with you.
But at every moment, every configuration\h\h

1760
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:44,720
of atoms and molecules seems\h
completely indistinguishable.

1761
02:25:44,720 --> 02:25:50,319
Experience tells us that the atoms are unlikely\h
to spontaneously gather in one corner of the room,\h

1762
02:25:50,319 --> 02:25:53,840
But if we started with all the\h
atoms of air in one corner,\h\h

1763
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:56,920
they would rapidly spread out and fill the room.\h

1764
02:25:56,920 --> 02:26:01,520
Boltzmann showed that this difference\h
is simply a matter of statistics,\h

1765
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:07,080
That specific atomic configurations\h
evolve into more general configurations.\h

1766
02:26:07,080 --> 02:26:13,559
This evolution of configurations, from specific\h
to general, is known as the growth of entropy,\h

1767
02:26:13,560 --> 02:26:20,241
And it has become one of the most\h
fundamental rules of the cosmos.\h

1768
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:24,680
Because these notions of\h
specific to general atomic\h\h

1769
02:26:24,680 --> 02:26:32,200
configurations can be thought of another way,
That order eventually gives way to disorder.

1770
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:35,439
Let’s try and understand this in terms of energy.

1771
02:26:35,439 --> 02:26:40,719
The total energy in any particular scenario\h
must remain constant - this is another\h\h

1772
02:26:40,720 --> 02:26:45,040
of the rules of thermodynamics,
But not all energy is the same,\h\h

1773
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:50,319
some of it is useful, and some of it not -
The growth of entropy means that useful\h\h

1774
02:26:50,319 --> 02:26:55,439
energy is degraded into useless energy.

1775
02:26:55,439 --> 02:27:00,040
Imagine you have a cylinder of compressed air.
This scenario is a little like the situation where\h\h

1776
02:27:00,040 --> 02:27:05,519
you have all your air in the corner of the room.
This highly specific case is said to have low\h\h

1777
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:10,279
entropy as it has lots of useful energy.
And to tap this energy, all you have to\h\h

1778
02:27:10,279 --> 02:27:13,240
do is open the valve.
The rush of air from\h\h

1779
02:27:13,240 --> 02:27:17,760
the valve can be used to spin a wheel,
And this spinning wheel can be used to do some\h\h

1780
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:22,920
useful work, such as generate an electric current.
But eventually, when all the pressures have\h\h

1781
02:27:22,920 --> 02:27:26,720
equalized, the rush of air stops,
The wheel stops spinning,\h\h

1782
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:33,200
and no more useful energy can be extracted.
This is true of every physical process,\h\h

1783
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:37,960
with useful energy constantly\h
degraded into useless energy.

1784
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:41,439
Indeed, your body is constantly\h
fighting the growth of entropy,\h

1785
02:27:41,439 --> 02:27:45,799
But to do so, you need a supply of\h
concentrated energy from the food you eat,\h

1786
02:27:45,800 --> 02:27:50,120
Which you process into more useless energy\h
in the form of waste and an infrared glow,\h

1787
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:57,559
You are doing your part in constantly\h
increasing the entropy of the universe.

1788
02:27:57,560 --> 02:28:02,359
Entropy has been rising since the dawn of time,\h
with useful energy constantly diminishing,\h

1789
02:28:02,359 --> 02:28:06,639
And the question of why the universe\h
was born with extremely low entropy,\h\h

1790
02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:10,240
so lots of useful energy, is unanswered.

1791
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:16,439
But eventually, in the far distant future, there\h
will be no useful energy left in the cosmos,\h

1792
02:28:16,439 --> 02:28:20,120
And the universe will have entered\h
the state of maximum entropy.

1793
02:28:24,279 --> 02:28:29,319
And so, as we have seen before, it appears\h
that we have reached the end of our story,\h

1794
02:28:29,319 --> 02:28:35,240
For what can happen in this maximum entropy\h
cosmos with no useful energy available?\h

1795
02:28:35,240 --> 02:28:41,240
But remember, the rules of thermodynamics laid\h
out by Boltzmann are statistical in nature,\h

1796
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:44,559
And in these statistics, bound by probabilities,\h\h

1797
02:28:44,560 --> 02:28:48,399
even the seemingly impossible\h
can eventually happen.

1798
02:28:48,399 --> 02:28:53,040
Perhaps the air in your room could\h
spontaneously gathering into a single corner,\h\h

1799
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:57,359
or billiard balls could rearrange\h
into their starting formation.

1800
02:28:57,359 --> 02:29:00,639
Boltzmann said that whilst\h
this is highly improbable,\h\h

1801
02:29:00,640 --> 02:29:05,920
if we wait long enough, it must happen.
How long might be a very long time,\h\h

1802
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:10,800
much longer than the current age of the universe,
But if there is one thing the future cosmos will\h\h

1803
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:15,960
have in abundance, that is time.
In the ultimate disordered state\h\h

1804
02:29:15,960 --> 02:29:24,833
of the future universe, order will\h
sometimes spontaneously arise.

1805
02:29:24,833 --> 02:29:27,560
And so every-so-often the\h
laws of thermodynamics and\h\h

1806
02:29:27,560 --> 02:29:31,520
quantum mechanics will fluctuate.
These fluctuations will generally\h\h

1807
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:34,960
bring some particles into being\h
before they fluctuate away again.\h

1808
02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:38,640
the universe going back to\h
being quiet and uneventful.

1809
02:29:38,640 --> 02:29:46,000
And even rarer than every-so-often, fluctuations\h
will bring more substantial things into being.\h

1810
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:51,800
Vanishingly rarely, the complexity of a\h
human mind will fluctuate into existence.\h

1811
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:57,200
Usually, these will be a blank slate, not\h
thinking a single thought before vanishing again,\h

1812
02:29:57,200 --> 02:30:03,920
But rarer still, a mind with\h
memories and experiences will occur.

1813
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:09,720
These ethereal minds are known as Boltzmann\h
Brains and are extremely rare events.\h

1814
02:30:09,720 --> 02:30:16,319
But with infinite time available they\h
will appear again and again and again.\h

1815
02:30:16,319 --> 02:30:21,479
And over and over again, even your exact\h
consciousness will pop into existence.\h

1816
02:30:21,479 --> 02:30:25,439
Your consciousness with all of\h
your memories and experiences.

1817
02:30:25,439 --> 02:30:28,399
An infinite number of times.

1818
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:32,000
Picking one of these at random, you are much\h\h

1819
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:36,920
more likely to be a Boltzmann’s\h
Brain in a cold, dead universe,\h

1820
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:43,240
Than a physical, fleshy human\h
enjoying a green, ripe apple.

1821
02:30:43,240 --> 02:30:50,080
You – the mind watching this video – temporary.
Your existence simply a fluctuation,\h\h

1822
02:30:50,080 --> 02:31:00,004
in an instant, you will be gone.

1823
02:31:00,061 --> 02:31:05,399
Are you absolutely sure that you have not just\h
popped into existence and are about to disappear?

1824
02:31:05,399 --> 02:31:09,160
Are you sure you are still here?

1825
02:31:09,160 --> 02:31:10,479
Yes.

1826
02:31:10,479 --> 02:31:14,679
At least for now.

1827
02:31:14,680 --> 02:31:19,680
And so for one final time your\h
eyes settle on the solitary apple.\h

1828
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:25,120
The apple that sent you on this journey\h
looking for the nature of reality.

1829
02:31:25,120 --> 02:31:30,200
Your mind flashes across all the versions\h
of reality you encountered in your dozing,\h

1830
02:31:30,200 --> 02:31:34,160
From the forms of Plato, through the\h
weird world of quantum mechanics.\h

1831
02:31:34,160 --> 02:31:40,599
Across block universes, and in\h
and out of holographic cosmoses.

1832
02:31:40,600 --> 02:31:45,399
But clarity returns as your\h
stomach starts to rumble.

1833
02:31:45,399 --> 02:31:48,240
Again, you focus on the apple.

1834
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:53,760
You reach out and pick it up, feeling\h
the smoothness of its skin in your hand.

1835
02:31:53,760 --> 02:32:03,520
You take a bite.
